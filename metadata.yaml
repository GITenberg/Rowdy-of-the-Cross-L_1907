description: This short but engaging novel contains all of the elements that made
  B.M. Bower's books a mainstay of the genre of classic Westerns. Rowdy Vaughn is
  a goodhearted but somewhat uncouth range rider whose attempts at wooing the local
  schoolteacher are hampered by a longstanding blood feud. Meanwhile, Rowdy's boss
  is struggling to keep his herd alive during a brutal drought. It's a little slice
  of life in the untamed West that is sure to please Western fans.
