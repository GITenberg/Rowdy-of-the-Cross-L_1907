    <h2>
      CHAPTER 1. Lost in a Blizzard.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rowdy&rdquo; Vaughan&mdash;he had been christened Rowland by his mother, and
      rechristened Rowdy by his cowboy friends, who are prone to treat with much
      irreverence the names bestowed by mothers&mdash;was not happy. He stood in
      the stirrups and shook off the thick layer of snow which clung, damp and
      close-packed, to his coat. The dull yellow folds were full of it; his gray
      hat, pulled low over his purple ears, was heaped with it. He reached up a
      gloved hand and scraped away as much as he could, wrapped the
      long-skirted, &ldquo;sour-dough&rdquo; coat around his numbed legs, then settled into
      the saddle with a shiver of distaste at the plight he was in, and wished
      himself back at the Horseshoe Bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dixie, standing knee-deep in a drift, shook himself much after the manner
      of his master; perhaps he, also, wished himself back at the Horseshoe Bar.
      He turned his head to look back, blinking at the snow which beat
      insistently in his eyes; he could not hold them open long enough to see
      anything, however, so he twitched his ears pettishly and gave over the
      attempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's up to you, old boy,&rdquo; Rowdy told him resignedly. &ldquo;I'm plumb lost; I
      never was in this damn country before, anyhow&mdash;and I sure wish I
      wasn't here now. If you've any idea where we're at, I'm dead willing to
      have you pilot the layout. Never mind Chub; locating his feed when it's
      stuck under his nose is his limit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chub lifted an ear dispiritedly when his name was spoken; but, as was
      usually the case, he heard no good of himself, and dropped his head again.
      No one took heed of him; no one ever did. His part was to carry Vaughan's
      bed, and to follow unquestionably where Vaughan and Dixie might lead. He
      was cold and tired and hungry, but his faith in his master was strong; the
      responsibility of finding shelter before the dark came down rested not
      with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vaughan pressed his chilled knees against Dixie's ribs, but the hand upon
      the reins was carefully non-committal; so that Dixie, having no suggestion
      of his master's wish, ventured to indulge his own. He turned tail squarely
      to the storm and went straight ahead. Vaughan put his hands deep into his
      pockets, snuggled farther down into the sheepskin collar of his coat, and
      rode passive, enduring.
    </p>
    <p>
      They brought up against a wire fence, and Vaughan, rousing from his
      apathy, tried to peer through the white, shifting wall of the storm.
      &ldquo;You're a swell guide&mdash;not,&rdquo; he remarked to the horse. &ldquo;Now you, you
      hike down this fence till you locate a gate or a corner, or any darned
      thing; and I don't give a cuss if the snow does get in your eyes. It's
      your own fault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dixie, sneezing the snow from his nostrils, turned obediently; Chub, his
      feet dragging wearily in the snow, trailed patiently behind. Half an hour
      of this, and it seemed as if it would go on forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the swirl Vaughan could see the posts standing forlornly in the
      snow, with sixteen feet of blizzard between; at no time could he
      distinguish more than two or three at once, and there were long minutes
      when the wall stood, blank and shifting, just beyond the first post.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Dixie lifted his head and gazed questioningly before him, his ears
      pointed forward&mdash;sentient, strained&mdash;and whinnied shrill
      challenge. He hurried his steps, dragging Chub out of the beginnings of a
      dream. Vaughan straightened and took his hands from his pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out beyond the dim, wavering outline of the farthest post came answer to
      the challenge. A mysterious, vague shape grew impalpably upon the strained
      vision; a horse sneezed, then nickered eagerly. Vaughan drew up and
      waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; he called cheerfully. &ldquo;Pleasant day, this. Out for your health?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The shape hesitated, as though taken aback by the greeting, and there was
      no answer. Vaughan, puzzled, rode closer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, don't talk so fast!&rdquo; he yelled. &ldquo;I can't follow yuh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&mdash;who is it?&rdquo; The voice sounded perturbed; and it was, moreover,
      the voice of a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vaughan pulled up short and swore into his collar. Women are not, as a
      rule, to be met out on the blank prairie in a blizzard. His voice, when he
      spoke again, was not ironical, as it had been; it was placating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I thought it was a man. I'm looking for the
      Cross L; you don't happen to know where it is, do yuh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;I don't,&rdquo; she declared dismally. &ldquo;I don't know where any place
      is. I'm teaching school in this neighborhood&mdash;or in some other. I was
      going to spend Sunday with a friend, but this storm came up, and I'm&mdash;lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Same here,&rdquo; said Rowdy pleasantly, as though being lost was a matter for
      congratulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I was in hopes&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So was I, so we're even there. We'll have to pool our chances, I guess.
      Any gate down that way&mdash;or haven't you followed the fence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I followed it for miles and miles&mdash;it seemed. It must be some big
      field of the Cross L; but they have so very many big fields!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you couldn't give a rough guess at how far it is to the Cross L?&rdquo;&mdash;insinuatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could vaguely see her shake of head. &ldquo;Ordinarily it should be about six
      miles beyond Rodway's, where I board. But I haven't the haziest idea of
      where Rodway's place is, you see; so that won't help you much. I'm all at
      sea in this snow.&rdquo; Her voice was rueful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you came up the fence, there's no use going back that way; and
      there's sure nothing made by going away from it.&mdash;that's the way I
      came. Why not go on the way you're headed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We might as well, I suppose,&rdquo; she assented; and Rowdy turned and rode by
      her side, grateful for the plurality of the pronoun which tacitly included
      him in her wanderings, and meditating many things. For one, he wondered if
      she were as nice a girl as her voice sounded. He could not see much of her
      face, because it was muffled in a white silk scarf. Only her eyes showed,
      and they were dark and bright.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he awoke to the fact that the wind, grown colder, beat upon her
      cruelly, he dropped behind a pace and took the windy side, that he might
      shield her with his body. But if she observed the action she gave no sign;
      her face was turned from him and the wind, and she rode without speaking.
      After long plodding, the line of posts turned unexpectedly a right angle,
      and Vaughan took a long, relieved breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll have the wind on our backs now,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;I guess we may as
      well keep on and see where this fence goes to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His tone was too elaborately cheerful to be very cheering. He was
      wondering if the girl was dressed warmly. It had been so warm and sunny
      before the blizzard struck, but now the wind searched out the thin places
      in one's clothing and ran lead in one's bones, where should be simply
      marrow. He fancied that her voice, when she spoke, gave evidence of actual
      suffering&mdash;and the heart of Rowdy Vaughan was ever soft toward a
      woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you're cold,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;I'll open up my bed and get out a blanket.&rdquo;
       He held Dixie in tentatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don't trouble to do that,&rdquo; she protested; but there was that in her
      voice which hardened his impulse into fixed resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to have thought of it before,&rdquo; he lamented, and swung down
      stiffly into the snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes followed his movement with a very evident interest while he
      unbuckled the pack Chub had carried since sunrise and drew out a blanket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand in your stirrup,&rdquo; he commanded briskly &ldquo;and I'll wrap you up. It's
      a Navajo, and the wind will have a time trying to find a thin spot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're thoughtful.&rdquo; She snuggled into it thankfully. &ldquo;I was cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vaughan tucked it around her with more care than haste. He was pretty
      uncomfortable himself, and for that reason he was the more anxious that
      the girl should be warm. It came to him that she was a cute little
      schoolma'am, all right; he was glad she belonged close around the Cross L.
      He also wished he knew her name&mdash;and so he set about finding it out,
      with much guile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How's that?&rdquo; he wanted to know, when he had made sure that her feet&mdash;such
      tiny feet&mdash;were well covered. He thought it lucky that she did not
      ride astride, after the manner of the latter-day young woman, because then
      he could not have covered her so completely. &ldquo;Hold on! That windy side's
      going to make trouble.&rdquo; He unbuckled the strap he wore to hold his own
      coat snug about him, and put it around the girl's slim waist, feeling
      idiotically happy and guilty the while. &ldquo;It don't come within a mile of
      you,&rdquo; he complained; &ldquo;but it'll help some.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sheltered in the thick folds of the Navajo, she laughed, and the sound of
      it sent the blood galloping through Rowdy Vaughan's body so that he was
      almost warm. He went and scraped the snow out of his saddle, and swung up,
      feeling that, after all, there are worse things in the world than being
      lost and hungry in a blizzard, with a sweet-voiced, bright-eyed little
      schoolma'am who can laugh like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want to have you think I may be a bold, bad robber-man,&rdquo; he said,
      when they got going again. &ldquo;My name's Rowdy Vaughan&mdash;for which I beg
      your pardon. Mother named me Rowland, never knowing I'd get out here and
      have her nice, pretty name mutilated that way. I won't say that my
      behavior never suggested the change, though. I'm from the Horseshoe Bar,
      over the line, and if I have my way, I'll be a Cross L man before another
      day.&rdquo; Then he waited expectantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For fear you may think I'm a&mdash;a robber-woman,&rdquo; she answered him
      solemnly&mdash;he felt sure her eyes twinkled, if only he could have seen
      them&mdash;&ldquo;I'm Jessie Conroy. And if you're from over the line, maybe you
      know my brother Harry. He was over there a year or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rowdy hunched his shoulders&mdash;presumably at the wind. Harry Conroy's
      sister, was she? And he swore. &ldquo;I may have met him,&rdquo; he parried, in a tone
      you'd never notice as being painstakingly careless. &ldquo;I think I did, come
      to think of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Conroy seemed displeased, and presently the cause was forthcoming.
      &ldquo;If you'd ever met him,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you'd hardly forget him.&rdquo; (Rowdy
      mentally agreed profanely.) &ldquo;He's the best rider in the whole country&mdash;and
      the handsomest. He&mdash;he's splendid! And he's the only brother I've
      got. It's a pity you never got acquainted with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; lied Rowdy, and thought a good deal in a very short time. Harry
      Conroy's sister! Well, she wasn't to blame for that, of course; nor for
      thinking her brother a white man. &ldquo;I remember I did see him ride once,&rdquo; he
      observed. &ldquo;He was a whirlwind, all right&mdash;and he sure was handsome,
      too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Conroy turned her face toward him and smiled her pleasure, and Rowdy
      hovered between heaven and&mdash;another place. He was glad she smiled,
      and he was afraid of what that subject might discover for his
      straightforward tongue in the way of pitfalls. It would not be nice to let
      her know what he really thought of her brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This looks to me like a lane,&rdquo; he said diplomatically. &ldquo;We must be
      getting somewhere; don't you recognize any landmarks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Conroy leaned forward and peered through the clouds of snow dust.
      Already the night was creeping down upon the land, stealthily turning the
      blank white of the blizzard into as blank a gray&mdash;which was as near
      darkness as it could get, because of the snow which fell and fell, and yet
      seemed never to find an abiding-place, but danced and swirled giddily in
      the wind as the cold froze it dry. There would be no more damp, clinging
      masses that night; it was sifting down like flour from a giant sieve; and
      of the supply there seemed no end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know of any lanes around here,&rdquo; she began dubiously, &ldquo;unless it's&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vaughan looked sharply at her muffled figure and wondered why she broke
      off so suddenly. She was staring hard at the few, faint traces of
      landmarks; and, bundled in the red-and-yellow Navajo blanket, with her
      bright, dark eyes, she might easily have passed for a slim young squaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out ahead, a dog began barking vaguely, and Rowdy turned eagerly to the
      sound. Dixie, scenting human habitation, stepped out more briskly through
      the snow, and even Chub lifted an ear briefly to show he heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may not be any one you know,&rdquo; Vaughan remarked, and his voice showed
      his longing; &ldquo;but it'll be shelter and a warm fire&mdash;and supper. Can
      you appreciate such blessings, Miss Conroy? I can. I've been in the saddle
      since sunrise; and I was so sure I'd strike the Cross L by dinner-time
      that I didn't bring a bite to eat. It was a sheep-camp where I stopped,
      and the grub didn't look good to me, anyway&mdash;I've called myself bad
      names all the afternoon for being more dainty than sensible. But it's all
      right now, I guess.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 2. Miss Conroy Refuses Shelter.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The storm lifted suddenly, as storms have a way of doing, and a low, squat
      ranch-house stood dimly revealed against the bleak expanse of
      wind-tortured prairie. Rowdy gave an exultant little whoop and made for
      the gate, leaned and swung it open and rode through, dragging Chub after
      him by main strength, as usual. When he turned to close the gate after
      Miss Conroy he found her standing still in the lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on in,&rdquo; he called, with a trace of impatience born of his weariness
      and hunger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, no.&rdquo; Miss Conroy's voice was as crisply cold as the wind which
      fluttered the Navajo blanket around her face. &ldquo;I much prefer the
      blizzard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Rowdy found nothing to say; he just stared. Miss Conroy
      shifted uneasily in the saddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is old Bill Brown's place,&rdquo; she explained reluctantly. &ldquo;He&mdash;I'd
      rather freeze than go in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I guess that won't be hard to do,&rdquo; he retorted curtly, &ldquo;if you stay
      out much longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dog was growing hysterical over their presence, and Bill Brown himself
      came out to see what it was all about. He could see two dim figures at the
      gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Why don't yuh come on in? What yuh standing there
      chewing the rag for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vaughan hesitated, his eyes upon Miss Conroy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go in,&rdquo; she commanded imperiously, quite as if he were a refractory
      pupil. &ldquo;You're tired out, and hungry. I'm neither. Besides, I know where I
      am now. I can find my way without any trouble. Go in, I tell you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Rowdy stayed where he was, with the gate creaking to and fro between
      them. Dixie circled till his back was to the wind. &ldquo;I hope you don't think
      you're going to mill around out here alone,&rdquo; Rowdy said tartly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can manage very well. I'm not lost now, I tell you. Rodway's is only
      three miles from here, and I know the direction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bill Brown waded out to them, wondering what weighty discussion was
      keeping them there in the cold. Vaughan he passed by with the cursory
      glance of a disinterested stranger, and went on to where Miss Conroy
      waited stubbornly in the lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's you!&rdquo; he said grimly. &ldquo;Well, come in and thaw out; I hope yuh
      didn't think yuh wouldn't be welcome yuh knew better. You got lost, I
      reckon. Come on&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Conroy struck Badger sharply across the flank and disappeared into
      the night. &ldquo;When I ask shelter of you,&rdquo; she flung back, &ldquo;you'll know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rowdy started after, and met Bill Brown squarely in the gate. Bill eyed
      him sharply. &ldquo;Say, young fellow, how'd you come by that packhorse?&rdquo; he
      demanded, as Chub brushed past him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None of your damn' business,&rdquo; snapped Rowdy, and drove the spurs into
      Dixie's ribs. But Chub was a handicap at any time; now, when he was tired,
      there was no getting anything like speed out of him; he clung to his
      shuffling trot, which was really no better than a walk. After five minutes
      spent alternately in spurring Dixie and yanking at Chub's lead-rope, Rowdy
      grew frightened and took to shouting. While they were in the lane Miss
      Conroy must perforce ride straight ahead, but the lane would not last
      always. As though with malicious intent, the snow swooped down again and
      the world became an unreal, nightmare world, wherein was nothing save
      shifting, blinding snowfloury and wind and bitter, numbing cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rowdy stood in his stirrups, cupped his chilled fingers around his numbed
      lips, and sent a longdrawn &ldquo;Who-ee!&rdquo; shrilling weirdly into the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to him, after long listening, that from the right came faint
      reply, and he turned and rode recklessly, swearing at Chub for his
      slowness. He called again, and the answer, though faint, was unmistakable.
      He settled heavily into the saddle&mdash;too weak, from sheer relief, to
      call again. He had not known till then just how frightened he had been,
      and he was somewhat disconcerted at the discovery. In a minute the
      reaction passed and he shouted a loud hello.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello?&rdquo; came the voice of Miss Conroy, tantalizingly calm, and as
      superior as the greeting of Central. &ldquo;Were you looking for me, Mr.
      Vaughan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was close to him&mdash;so close that she had not needed to raise her
      voice perceptibly. Rowdy rode up alongside, remembering uncomfortably his
      prolonged shouting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sure was,&rdquo; he admitted. And then: &ldquo;You rode off with my blanket on.&rdquo; He
      was very proud of his matter-of-fact tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Miss Conroy was almost deceived, and a bit disappointed. &ldquo;I'll give
      it to you now, and you can go back&mdash;if you know the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No hurry,&rdquo; said Rowdy politely. &ldquo;I'll go on and see if you can find a
      place that looks good to you. You seem pretty particular.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Conroy may have blushed, in the shelter of the blanket. &ldquo;I suppose it
      did look strange to you,&rdquo; she confessed, but defiantly. &ldquo;Bill Brown is an
      enemy to&mdash;Harry. He&mdash;because he lost a horse or two out of a
      field, one time, he&mdash;he actually accused Harry of taking them! He
      lied, of course, and nobody believed him; nobody could believe a thing
      like that about Harry. It was perfectly absurd. But he did his best to
      hurt Harry's name, and I would rather freeze than ask shelter of him.
      Wouldn't you&mdash;in my place, I mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always stand up for my friends,&rdquo; evaded Rowdy. &ldquo;And if I had a brother&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you'd be loyal,&rdquo; approved Miss Conroy warmly. &ldquo;But I didn't
      want you to come on; it isn't your quarrel. And I know the way now. You
      needn't have come any farther.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forgot the blanket,&rdquo; Rowdy reminded wickedly. &ldquo;I think a lot of that
      Navajo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You insisted upon my taking it,&rdquo; she retorted, and took refuge in
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long hour they plodded blindly. Rowdy beat his hands often about his
      body to start the blood, and meditated yearnigly upon hot coffee and the
      things he liked best to eat. Also, a good long pull at a flask wouldn't be
      had, either, he thought. And he hoped this little schoolma'am knew where
      she was going&mdash;truth to tell, he doubted it.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a while, it seemed that Miss Conroy doubted it also. She took to
      leaning forward and straining her eyes to see through the gray wall
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There should be a gate here,&rdquo; she said dubiously, at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; Rowdy ventured mildly, &ldquo;if there were a gate, it would
      have some kind of a fence hitched to it; wouldn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Conroy was in no mood for facetiousness, and refused to answer his
      question. &ldquo;I surely can't have made a mistake,&rdquo; she observed uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be a wonder if you didn't, such a night as this,&rdquo; he consoled.
      &ldquo;I wouldn't bank on traveling straight myself, even if I knew the country&mdash;which
      I don't. And I've been in more blizzards than I'm years old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rodway's place can't be far away,&rdquo; she said, brightening. &ldquo;It may be
      farther to the east; shall we try that way&mdash;if you know which is
      east?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, we'll try. It's all we can do. My packhorse is about all in, from
      the way he hangs back; if we don't strike something pretty soon I'll have
      to turn him loose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don't do that,&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;It would be too cruel. We're sure to
      reach Rodway's very soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      More plodding through drifts high and drifts low; more leaning from
      saddles to search anxiously for trace of something besides snow and wind
      and biting cold. Then, far to the right, a yellow eye glowed briefly when
      the storm paused to take breath. Miss Conroy gave a glad little cry and
      turned Badger sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see? It was the light from a window. We were going the wrong way.
      I'm sure that is Rodway's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rowdy thanked the Lord and followed her. They came up against a fence,
      found a gate, and passed through. While they hurried toward it, the light
      winked welcome; as they drew near, some one stirred the fire and sent
      sparks and rose-hued smoke rushing up into the smother of snow. Rowdy
      watched them wistfully, and wondered if there would be supper, and strong,
      hot coffee. He lifted Miss Conroy out of the saddle, carried her two long
      strides, and deposited her upon the door-step; rapped imperatively, and
      when a voice replied, lifted the latch and pushed her in before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a minute they stood blinking, just within the door. The change from
      numbing cold and darkness to the light of the overheated room was
      stupefying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Miss Conroy went over and held her little, gloved hands to the heat
      of the stove, but she did not take the chair which some one pushed toward
      her. She stood, the blanket shrouding her face and her slim young figure,
      and looked about her curiously. It was not Rodway's house, after all. She
      thought she knew what place it was&mdash;the shack where Rodway's
      hay-balers bached.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the first, Rowdy did not like the look of things&mdash;though for
      himself it did not matter; he was used to such scenes. It was the presence
      of the girl which made him uncomfortable. He unbuttoned his coat that the
      warmth might reach his chilled body, and frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four men sat around a small, dirty table; evidently the arrivals had
      interrupted an exciting game of seven-up. A glance told Rowdy, even if his
      nose had not, that the four round, ribbed bottles had not been nearly
      emptied without effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have one on the house,&rdquo; the man nearest him cried, and shoved a bottle
      toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Involuntarily Rowdy reached for it. Now that he was inside, he realized
      all at once how weary he was, and cold and hungry. Each abused muscle and
      nerve seemed to have a distinct grievance against him. His fingers closed
      around the bottle before he remembered and dropped it. He looked up,
      hoping Miss Conroy had not observed the action; met her wide, questioning
      eyes, and the blood flew guiltily to his cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, boys&mdash;not any for me,&rdquo; he said, and apologized to Miss
      Conroy with his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man rose and confronted him unsteadily. &ldquo;Dat's a hell off a way! You
      too proud for drink weeth us? You drink, now! By Gar, I make you drink!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rowdy's eyelids drooped, which was a bad sign for those who knew him.
      &ldquo;You're forgetting there's a lady present,&rdquo; he reminded warningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man turned a brief, contemptuous glance toward the stove. &ldquo;You got the
      damn' queer way to talk. I don't call no squaw no lady. You drink queeck,
      now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, shut up, Frenchy,&rdquo; the man at his elbow abjured him. &ldquo;He don't have
      to drink if he don't want to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You keep the face close,&rdquo; the other retorted majestically; and cursed
      loud and long and incoherently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rowdy drew back his arm, with a fist that meant trouble for somebody; but
      there were others before him who pinned the importunate host to the table,
      where he squirmed unavailingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rowdy buttoned up his coat the while he eyed the group disgustedly. &ldquo;I
      guess we'll drift,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;You don't look good to me, and that's no
      dream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, stay and warm up,&rdquo; the fourth man expostulated. &ldquo;Yuh don't need t'
      mind Le Febre; he's drunk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Rowdy opened the door decisively, and Miss Conroy, her cheeks like two
      storm-buffeted poppies, followed him out with dignity&mdash;albeit
      trailing a yard of red-and-yellow Navajo blanket behind her. Rowdy lifted
      her into the saddle, tucked her feet carefully under the blanket, and said
      never a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Vaughan,&rdquo; she began hesitatingly, &ldquo;this is too bad; you need not have
      left. I&mdash;I wasn't afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you weren't,&rdquo; conceded Rowdy. &ldquo;But it was a hard formation&mdash;for
      a woman. Are there any more places on this flat marked Unavailable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Conroy replied misanthropically that if there were they would be sure
      to find them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They took up their weary wanderings again, while the yellow eye of the
      window winked after them. They missed Rodway's by a scant hundred yards,
      and didn't know it, because the side of the house next them had no lighted
      windows. They traveled in a wide, half circle, and thought that they were
      leaving a straight trail behind them. More than once Rowdy was urged by
      his aching arm to drop the lead-rope and leave Chub to shift by himself,
      but habit was strong and his heart was soft. Then he felt an odd twitching
      at the lead-rope, as if Chub were minded to rebel against their
      leadership. Rowdy yanked him into remembrance of his duty, and wondered.
      Bill Brown's question came insistently to mind; he wondered the more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two minutes and the lead-rope was sawing against the small of his back
      again. Rowdy turned Dixie's head, and spoke for the first time in an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My packhorse seems to have an idea about where he wants to go,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;I guess we might as well follow him as anybody; he ain't often taken with
      a rush of brains to the head. And we can't be any worse lost than we are
      now, can we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Conroy said no dispiritedly, and they swung about and followed Chub's
      leadership apathetically. It took Chub just five minutes to demonstrate
      that he knew what he was about. When he stopped, it was with his nose
      against a corral gate; not content with that, he whinnied, and a new,
      exultant note was in the sound. A deep-voiced dog bayed loudly, and a
      shrill yelp cut in and clamored for recognition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Conroy gasped. &ldquo;It's Lion and Skeesicks. We're at Rodway's, Mr.
      Vaughan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rowdy, for the second time, thanked the Lord. But when he was stripping
      the pack off Chub's back, ten minutes later, he was thinking many things
      he would not have cared to say aloud. It might be all right, but it sure
      was strange, he told himself, that Chub belonged here at Rodway's when
      Harry Conroy claimed that he was an Oregon horse. Rowdy had thought his
      account against Harry Conroy long enough, but it looked now as though
      another item must be added to the list. He went in and ate his supper
      thoughtfully, and when he got into bed he did not fall asleep within two
      minutes, as he might be expected to do. His last conscious thought was not
      of stolen horses, however. It was: &ldquo;And she's Harry Conroy's sister! Now,
      what do you think of that? But all the same, she's sure a nice little
      schoolma'am.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 3. Rowdy Hires a New Boss.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Next morning, after breakfast, Mr. Rodway followed Vaughan out to the
      stable, and repeated Bill Brown's question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd like to know where yuh got this horse,&rdquo; he began, with an apologetic
      sort of determination in his tone. &ldquo;He happens to belong to me. He was run
      off with a bunch three years ago, and this is the first trace anybody has
      ever got of 'em. I see the brand's been worked. It was a Roman four&mdash;that's
      my brand; now it looks like a map of Texas; but I'd swear to the horse&mdash;raised
      him from a colt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rowdy had expected something of the sort, and he knew quite well what he
      was going to do; he had settled that the night before, with the memory of
      Miss Conroy's eyes fresh in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got him in a deal across the line,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I was told he came from
      east Oregon. But last night, when he piloted us straight to your corral
      gate, I guessed he'd been here before. He's yours, all right, if you say
      so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uh course he ain't worth such a pile uh money,&rdquo; apologized Rodway, &ldquo;but
      the kids thought a heap of him. I'd rather locate some of the horses that
      was with him&mdash;or the man yuh got him of. They was some mighty good
      horses run out uh this country then, but they was all out on the range, so
      we didn't miss 'em in time to do any good. Do yu know who took 'em across
      the line?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Rowdy deliberately. &ldquo;The man I got Chub from went north, and I
      heard he got killed. I don't know of any other in the deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rodway grunted, and Vaughan began vigorously brushing Dixie's roughened
      coat. &ldquo;If you don't mind,&rdquo; he said, after a minute, &ldquo;I'd like to borrow
      Chub to pack my bed over to the Cross L. I can bring him back again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, sure!&rdquo; assented Rodway eagerly. &ldquo;I hate to take him from yuh, but
      the kids&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that's all right,&rdquo; interrupted Rowdy cheerfully. &ldquo;It's all in the
      game, and I should 'a' looked up his pedigree, for I knew&mdash;. Anyway,
      was worth the price of him to have him along last night. We'd have milled
      around till daylight, I guess, only for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what,&rdquo; agreed Rodway. &ldquo;Jessie's horse is one she brought from home
      lately, and he ain't located yet; I dunno as he'd 'a' piloted her home.
      Billy&mdash;that's what the kids named him&mdash;was born and raised here,
      yuh see. I'll bet he's glad to get back&mdash;and the kids'll be plumb
      wild.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rowdy did not answer; there seemed nothing in particular to say, and he
      was wondering if he would see Miss Conroy before he left. She had not
      eaten breakfast with the others; from their manner, he judged that no one
      expected her to. He was not well informed upon the subject of
      schoolma'ams, but he had a hazy impression that late rising was a
      distinguishing characteristic&mdash;and he did not know how late. He
      saddled leisurely, and packed his bed for the last time upon Chub. The
      red-and-yellow Navajo blanket he folded tenderly, with an unconscious
      smile for the service it had done, and laid it in its accustomed place in
      the bed. Then, having no plausible excuse for going back to the house, he
      mounted and rode away into the brilliant white world, watching wistfully
      the house from the tail of his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      She might have got up in time to see him off, he thought discontentedly;
      but he supposed one cowpuncher more or less made little difference to her.
      Anyway, he didn't know as he had any license to moon around her. She
      probably had a fellow; she might even be engaged, for all he knew. And&mdash;she
      was Harry Conroy's sister; and from his experience with the breed, good
      looks didn't count for anything. Harry was good-looking, and he was a
      snake, if ever there was one. He had never expected to lie for him&mdash;but
      he had done it, all right&mdash;and because Harry's sister happened to
      have nice eyes and a pretty little foot!&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had half a mind to go back and tell Rodway all he knew about those
      horses; it was only a matter of time, anyway, till Harry Conroy overshot
      the mark and got what was coming to him. He sure didn't owe Harry
      anything, that he had need to shield him like he had done. Still, Rodway
      would wonder why he hadn't told it at first; and that little girl believed
      in Harry, and said he was &ldquo;splendid!&rdquo; Humph! He wondered if she really
      meant that. If she did&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He squared his back to the house&mdash;and the memory of Miss Conroy's
      eyes&mdash;and plodded across the field to the gate. Now the sun was
      shining, and there was no possibility of getting lost. The way to the
      Cross L lay straight and plain before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rowdy rode leisurely up over the crest of a ridge beyond which lay the
      home ranch of the Cross L. Whether it was henceforth to be his home he had
      yet to discover&mdash;though there was reason for hoping that it would be.
      Even so venturesome a man as Rowdy Vaughan would scarce ride a long
      hundred miles through unpeopled prairie, in the tricky month of March,
      without some reason for expecting a welcome at the end of his journey. In
      this case, a previous acquaintance with &ldquo;Wooden Shoes&rdquo; Mielke, foreman of
      the Cross L, was Rowdy's trump-card. Wooden Shoes, whenever chance had
      brought them together in the last two or three years, was ever urging
      Rowdy to come over and unroll his soogans in the Cross L bed-tent, and
      promising the best string in the outfit to ride&mdash;besides other things
      alluring to a cow-puncher. So that, when his relations with the Horseshoe
      Bar became strained, Rowdy remembered his friend of the Cross L and the
      promises, and had drifted south.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just now he hoped that Wooden Shoes would be home to greet him, and his
      eyes searched wishfully the huddle of low-eaved cabins and the assortment
      of sheds and corrals for the bulky form of the foreman. But no one seemed
      to be about&mdash;except a bigbodied, bandy-legged individual, who
      appeared to be playfully chasing a big, bright bay stallion inside the
      large enclosure where stood the cabins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rowdy watched them impersonally; a glance proved that the man was not
      Wooden Shoes, and so he was not particularly interested in him or his
      doings. It did occur to him, however, that if the fellow wanted to catch
      that brute, he ought to have sense enough to get a horse. No one but a
      plumb idiot would mill around in that snow afoot. He jogged down the slope
      at a shuffling trot, grinning tolerantly at the pantomime below.
    </p>
    <p>
      He of the bandy-legs stopped, evidently out of breath; the stallion
      stopped also, snorting defiance. Rowdy heard him plainly, even at that
      distance. The horse arched his neck and watched the man warily, ready to
      be off at the first symptom of hostilities&mdash;and Rowdy observed that a
      short rope hung from his halter, swaying as he moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bandy-legs seemed to have an idea; he turned and scuttled to the nearest
      cabin, returning with what seemed a basin of oats, for he shook it
      enticingly and edged cautiously toward the horse. Rowdy could imagine him
      coaxing, with hypocritically endearing names, such as &ldquo;Good old boy!&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;Steady now, Billy&rdquo;&mdash;or whatever the horse's name might be. Rowdy
      chuckled to himself, and hoped the horse saw through the subterfuge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the horse chuckled also; at any rate, he stood quite still,
      equally prepared to bounce away on the instant or to don the mask of
      docility. Bandy-legs drew nearer and nearer, shaking the basin briskly,
      like an old woman sifting meal. The horse waited, his nostrils quivering
      hungrily at the smell of the oats, and with an occasional low nicker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bandy-legs went on tiptoes&mdash;or as nearly as he could in the snow&mdash;the
      basin at arm's length before. The dainty, flaring nostrils sniffed
      tentatively, dipped into the basin, and snuffed the oats about luxuriously&mdash;till
      he felt a stealthy hand seize the dangling rope. At the touch he snorted
      protest, and was off and away, upsetting Bandy-legs and the basin
      ignominiously into a high-piled drift.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bandy-legs sat up, scraped the snow out of his collar and his ears, and
      swore. It was then that Rowdy appeared like an angel of deliverance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Want that horse caught?&rdquo; he yelled cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bandy-legs lifted up his voice and bellowed things I should not like to
      repeat verbatim. But Rowdy gathered that the man emphatically did want
      that so-and-so-and-then-some horse caught, and that it couldn't be done a
      blessed minute too soon. Whereat Rowdy smiled anew, with his face
      discreetly turned away from Bandy-legs, and took down his rope and widened
      the loop. Also, he turned Chub loose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stallion evidently sensed what new danger threatened his stolen
      freedom, and circled the yard with high, springy strides. Rowdy circled
      after, saw his chance, swirled the loop twice over his head, and hazarded
      a long throw.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rowdy knew it for pure good luck that it landed right, but to this day
      Bandy-legs looks upon him as a Wonder with a rope&mdash;and Bandy-legs
      would insist upon the capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where shall I take him?&rdquo; Rowdy asked, coming up with his captive, and
      with nothing but his eyes to show how he was laughing inwardly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bandy-legs crawled from the drift, still scraping snow from inside his
      collar, and gave many directions about going through a certain gate into
      such-and-such a corral; from there into a stable; and by seeming devious
      ways into a minutely described stall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Rowdy, cutting short the last needless details. &ldquo;I guess
      I can find the trail;&rdquo; and started off, leading the stallion. Bandy-legs
      followed, and Chub, observing the departure of Dixie, ambled faithfully in
      the rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much obliged,&rdquo; conceded Bandy-legs, when the stallion was safely housed
      and tied securely. &ldquo;Where yuh headed for, young man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right here,&rdquo; Rowdy told him calmly, loosening Dixie's cinch. &ldquo;I'm the
      long-lost top hand that the Cross L's been watching the sky-line for, lo!
      these many moons, a-yearning for the privilege of handing me forty plunks
      about twice as fast as I've got 'em coming. Where's the boss?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;I'm him,&rdquo; confessed Bandy-legs meekly, and circled the two
      dubiously. &ldquo;I guess you've heard uh Eagle Creek Smith&mdash;I'm him. The
      Cross L belongs to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rowdy let out an explosive, and showed a row of nice teeth. &ldquo;Well, I ain't
      hard to please,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I won't kick on that, I guess. I like your
      looks tolerable well, and I'm willing to take yuh on for a boss. If yuh do
      your part, I bet we'll get along fine.&rdquo; His tone was banteringly
      patronizing &ldquo;Anyway, I'll try yuh for a spell. You can put my name down as
      Rowdy Vaughan, lately canned from the Horseshoe Bar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; ventured Bandy-legs&mdash;rather, Eagle Creek&mdash;still
      circling Rowdy dubiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for was I canned?&rdquo; repeated Rowdy easily. &ldquo;Being a modest youth, I
      hate t' tell yuh. But the old man's son and me, we disagreed, and one of
      his eyes swelled some; so did mine, a little.&rdquo; He stood head and shoulders
      above Eagle Creek, and he smiled down upon him engagingly. Eagle Creek
      capitulated before the smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I ain't got any sons&mdash;that I know of,&rdquo; he grinned. &ldquo;So I guess
      yuh can consider yourself a Cross L man till further notice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, sure!&rdquo; The teeth gleamed again briefly. &ldquo;That's what I've been
      telling you right along. Where's old Wooden Shoes? He's responsible for me
      being here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone to Chinook. He'll be back in a day or two.&rdquo; Eagle Creek shifted his
      feet awkwardly. &ldquo;Say&rdquo;&mdash;he glanced uneasily behind him&mdash;&ldquo;yuh
      don't want t' let it get around that yuh sort of&mdash;hired me&mdash;see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; Rowdy assured him. &ldquo;I was only joshing. If you don't want
      me, just tell me to hit the sod.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You stay right where you're at!&rdquo; commanded Eagle Creek with returned
      confidence in himself and his authority. Of a truth, this self-assured,
      straight-limbed young man had rather dazed him. &ldquo;Take your bed and war-bag
      up to the bunk-house and make yourself t' home till the boys get back, and&mdash;say,
      where'd yuh git that pack-horse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The laugh went out of Rowdy's tawny eyes. The question hit a spot that was
      becoming sore. &ldquo;I borrowed him this morning from Mr. Rodway,&rdquo; he said
      evenly. &ldquo;I'm to take him back to-day. I stopped there last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Eagle Creek coughed apologetically, and said no word, while Rowdy
      led Chub back to the cabin which he had pointed out as the bunk-house; he
      stood by while Rowdy loosened the pack and dragged it inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess you can get located here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I ain't workin' more'n three
      or four men just now, but there's quite a few uh the boys stopping here;
      the Cross L's a regular hang-out for cow-punchers. You're a little early
      for the season, but I'll see that yuh have something t' do&mdash;just t'
      keep yuh out uh devilment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rowdy's brows unbent; it would seem that Eagle Creek was capable of
      &ldquo;joshing&rdquo; also. &ldquo;It's up t' you, old-timer,&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;I'm strong and
      willing, and don't shy at anything but pitchforks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eagle Creek grinned. &ldquo;This ain't no blamed cowhospital,&rdquo; he gave as a
      parting shot. &ldquo;All the hay that's shoveled on this ranch needn't hurt
      nobody's feelings.&rdquo; With that he shut the door, and left Rowdy to acquaint
      himself with his new home.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 4. Pink as &ldquo;Chappyrone.&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      Rowdy was sprawled ungracefully upon somebody's bunk&mdash;he neither knew
      nor cared whose&mdash;and he was snoring unmelodiously, and not dreaming a
      thing; for when a cow-puncher has nothing in particular to do, he sleeps
      to atone for the weary hours when he must be very wide-awake. An avalanche
      descended upon his unwarned middle, and checked the rhythmic ebb and flow
      of sound. He squawked and came to life clawing viciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd like t' know where the devil yuh come from,&rdquo; a voice remarked
      plaintively in a soft treble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rowdy opened his eyes with a snap. &ldquo;Pink! by all that's good and bad! Get
      up off my diaphragm, you little fiend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pink absent-mindedly kneaded Rowdy's stomach with his knuckles, and
      immediately found himself in a far corner. He came back, dimpling
      mischievously. He looked much more an angel than a fiend, for all his
      Angora chaps and flame-colored scarf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your bed and war-bag's on my bunk; you're on Smoky's; and Dixie's makin'
      himself to home in the corral. By all them signs and tokens, I give a
      reckless guess you're here t' stay a while. That right?&rdquo; He prodded again
      at Rowdy's ribs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It sure is, Pink. And if I'd known you was holding out here, I'd 'a' come
      sooner, maybe. You sure look good to me, you darned little cuss!&rdquo; Rowdy
      sat up and took a lightning inventory of the four or five other fellows
      lounging about. He must have slept pretty sound, he thought, not to hear
      them come in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pink read the look, and bethought him of the necessary introductions.
      &ldquo;This is my side-kicker over the line that&mdash;you've heard about till
      you're plumb weary, boys,&rdquo; he announced musically. &ldquo;His name is Rowdy
      Vaughan&mdash;bronco-peeler, crap fiend, and all-round bad man. He ain't a
      safe companion, and yuh want t' sleep with your six-guns cuddled under
      your right ear, and never, on no account, show him your backs. He's a real
      wolf, he is, and the only reason I live t' tell the tale is because he
      respects m' size. Boys, I'm afraid for yuh&mdash;but I wish yuh well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pink, you need killing, and I'm tempted to live up to my rep,&rdquo; grinned
      Rowdy indulgently. &ldquo;Read me the pedigree of your friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they ain't no worse&mdash;when yuh git used to 'em. That long-legged
      jasper with the far-away look in his eyes is the Silent One&mdash;if he
      takes a notion t' you, he'll maybe tell yuh the name his mother calls him.
      He may have seen better days; but here's hoping he won't see no worse! He
      once was a tenderfoot; but he's convalescing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Silent One nodded carelessly, but with a quick, measuring glance that
      Rowdy liked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This unshaved savage is Smoky. He's harmless, if yuh don't mention
      socialism in his presence; and if yuh do, he'll
      down-with-the-trust-and-long-live-the-sons-uh-toil, all hours uh the
      night, and keep folks awake. Then him and the fellow that started him off
      'll likely get chapped good and plenty. Over there's Jim Ellis and Bob
      Nevin; they've both turned a cow or two, and I've seen worse specimens
      running around loose&mdash;plenty of 'em. That man hidin' behind the grin&mdash;you
      can see him if yuh look close&mdash;is Sunny Sam. Yuh needn't take no
      notice of him, unless you're a mind to. He won't care&mdash;he's dead
      gentle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he broke off, &ldquo;how'd you happen t' stray onto this range, anyhow?
      Yuh used t' belong t the Horseshoe Bar so solid the assessor always t' yuh
      down on the personal-property list.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They won't pay taxes on me no more, son.&rdquo; Rowdy's eyes dwelt fondly upon
      Pink's cupid-bow mouth and dimples. He had never dreamed of finding Pink
      here; though, when he came to think of it there was no reason why he
      shouldn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pink was not like any one else. He was slight and girlish to look at. But
      you mustn't trust appearances; for Pink was all muscle strung on steel
      wire, according to the belief of those who tried to handle him. He had
      little white hands, and feet that looked quite comfortable in a number
      four boot, and his hair was a tawny gold and curled in distracting, damp
      rings on his forehead. His eyes were blue and long-lashed and beautiful,
      and they looked at the world with baby innocence&mdash;whereas a more
      sophisticated little devil never jangled spurs at his heels. He was
      everything but insipid, and men liked him&mdash;unless he chose to dislike
      them, when they thought of him with grating teeth. To find him bullying
      the Cross L boys brought a warmth to Rowdy's heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pink made a cigarette, and then offered Rowdy his tobacco-sack, and asked
      questions about the Cypress Hills country. How was this girl?&mdash;and
      was that one married yet?&mdash;and did the other still grieve for him? As
      a matter of fact, he had yet to see the girl who could quicken his pulse a
      single beat, and for that reason it sometimes pleased him to affect
      susceptibility beyond that of other men.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was after dinner when he and Rowdy went humming down to the stables,
      gossiping like a couple of old women over a back fence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you've got Conroy's Chub yet,&rdquo; Pink observed carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, for Heaven's sake let up on that cayuse!&rdquo; Rowdy cried petulantly. &ldquo;I
      wish I'd never got sight of the little buzzard-head; I've had him crammed
      down my throat the last day or two till it's getting plumb monotonous.
      Pink, that cayuse never saw Oregon. He was raised right on this flat, and
      he belongs to old Rodway. I've got to lead him back there and turn him
      over to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pink took three puffs at his cigarette, and lifted his long lashes to
      Rowdy's gloom-filled face. &ldquo;Stole?&rdquo; he asked briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stole,&rdquo; Rowdy repeated disgustedly. &ldquo;So was the whole blame' bunch, as
      near as I can make out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We might 'a' knowed it. We might 'a' guessed Harry Conroy wouldn't have a
      straight title to anything if he could make it crooked. I bet he never
      finished paying back that money yuh lent him&mdash;out uh the kindness uh
      your heart. Did he?&rdquo; Pink leaned against the corral fence and kicked
      meditatively at a snow-covered rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did not, m' son. Chub's all I ever got out uh the deal&mdash;and I
      haven't even got him. I borrowed him from Rodway to pack my bed over&mdash;borrowed
      the blame' little runty cayuse that cost me sixty-four hard-earned
      dollars; that's what Harry borrowed of me. And every blame' gazabo on the
      flat wanted to know what I was doing with him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can tell yuh where t' find Conroy, Rowdy. He's working for an outfit
      down on the river. I'd sure fix him for this! Yuh got plenty of evidence;
      you can send him up like a charm. It was different when he cut your latigo
      strap in that rough-riding contest; yuh couldn't prove it on him. But this&mdash;why,
      man, it's a cinch!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't lost Harry Conroy, so I ain't looking for him just now,&rdquo;
       growled Rowdy. &ldquo;So long as he keeps out uh reach, I won't ask no more of
      him. And, Pink, I wish you'd keep this quiet&mdash;about him having Chub.
      I told Rodway I couldn't put him next to the fellow that brought that
      bunch across the line. I told him the fellow went north and got killed. He
      did go north&mdash;fifty miles or so; and he'd ought to been killed, if he
      wasn't. Let it go that way, Pink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pink looked like a cherub-faced child when he has been told there's no
      Santa Claus. &ldquo;Sure, if yuh say so,&rdquo; he stammered dubiously. He eyed Rowdy
      reproachfully, and then looked away to the horizon. He kicked the rock out
      of place, and then poked it painstakingly back with his toe&mdash;and from
      the look of him, he did not know there was a rock there at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How'd yuh happen to run across Rodway?&rdquo; he asked guilelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I stopped there last night. I got to milling around in that storm, and
      ran across the schoolma'am that boards at Rodway's, She was plumb lost,
      too, so we dubbed around together for a while, and finally got inside
      Rodway's field. Then Chub come alive and piloted us to the house. This
      morning Rodway claimed him&mdash;says the brand has been worked from a
      Roman four. Oh, it's all straight goods,&rdquo; he added hastily. &ldquo;Old Eagle
      Creek here knew him, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Pink was not thinking of Chub. He hunched his chap-belt higher and
      spat viciously into the snow. &ldquo;I knowed it,&rdquo; he declared, with melancholy
      triumph. &ldquo;It's school-ma'amitis that's gave yuh softening uh the vitals,
      and not no Christian charity play. How comes it you're took that way, all
      unbeknown t' your friends? Yuh never used t' bother about no female girls.
      It's a cinch you're wise that she's Harry's sister; and I admit she's a
      swell looker. But so's he; and I should think, Rowdy, you'd had about
      enough uh that brand uh snake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's nothing so snaky about her that I could see,&rdquo; defended Rowdy. He
      did not particularly relish having his own mental argument against Miss
      Conroy thrown back at him from another. &ldquo;She seemed to be all right; and
      if you'd seen how plucky she was in that blizzard&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I never heard anybody stand up and call Harry white-livered, when
      yuh come t' that,&rdquo; Pink cut in tartly. &ldquo;Anyway, you're a blame fool. If
      she was a little white-winged angel, yuh wouldn't stand no kind uh show;
      and I tell yuh why. She's got a little tin god that she says prayers to
      regular.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's Harry. And wouldn't he be the fine brother-in-law? He could borrow
      all your wages off'n yuh, and when yuh went t' make a pretty ride, he'd up
      and cut your latigo, and give yuh a fall. And he could work stolen horses
      off onto yuh&mdash;and yuh wouldn't give a damn, 'cause Jessie wears a
      number two shoe&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have done some rimrock riding after her yourself!&rdquo; jeered Rowdy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And has got shiny brown eyes, just like Harry's&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're not!&rdquo; laughed Rowdy, half-angrily. &ldquo;If you say that again, Pink,
      I'll stick your head in a snow-bank. Her eyes are all right. They sure
      look good to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've sure got 'em,&rdquo; mourned Pink. &ldquo;Yuh need t' be close-herded by your
      friends, and that's no dream. You wait till toward evening before yuh take
      that horse back. I'm going along t' chappyrone yuh, Rowdy. Yuh ain't safe
      running loose any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rowdy cursed him companionably and told him to go along, if he wanted to,
      and to look out he didn't throw up his own hands; and Pink grumbled and
      swore and did go along. But when they got there, Miss Conroy greeted him
      like a very good friend; which sent Rowdy sulky, and kept him so all the
      evening. It seemed to him that Pink was playing a double game, and when
      they started home he told him so.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Pink turned in his saddle and smiled so that his dimples showed
      plainly in the moonlight. &ldquo;Chappyrones that set in a corner and look wise
      are the rankest kind uh fakes,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;When she was talking to me,
      she was letting you alone&mdash;see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rowdy accepted the explanation silently, and stored it away in his memory.
      After that, by riding craftily, and by threats, and by much vituperation,
      he managed to reach Rodway's unchapperoned at least three times out of
      five&mdash;which was doing remarkably well, when one considers Pink.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 5. At Home at Cross L.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In two days Rowdy was quite at home with the Cross L. In a month he found
      himself transplanted from the smoke-laden air of the bunk-house, and set
      off from the world in a line camp, with nothing to do but patrol the boggy
      banks of Milk River, where it was still unfenced and unclaimed by small
      farmers. The only mitigation of his exile, so far as he could see, lay in
      the fact that he had Pink and the Silent One for companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      It developed that when he would speak to the Silent One, he must say Jim,
      or wait long for a reply. Also, the Silent One was not always silent, and
      he was quick to observe the weak points in those around him, and keen at
      repartee. When it pleased him so to do, he could handle the English
      language in a way that was perfectly amazing&mdash;and not always
      intelligible to the unschooled. At such times Pink frankly made no attempt
      to understand him; Rowdy, having been hustled through grammar school and
      two-thirds through high school before he ran away from a brand new
      stepmother, rather enjoyed the outbreaks and Pink's consequent disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not one of them loved particularly the line camp, and Rowdy least of all,
      since it put an extra ten miles between Miss Conroy and himself. Rowdy had
      got to that point where his mind dwelt much upon matters domestic, and he
      made many secret calculations on the cost of housekeeping for two. More
      than that, he put himself upon a rigid allowance for pocket-money&mdash;an
      allowance barely sufficient to keep him in tobacco and papers. All this
      without consulting Miss Conroy's wishes&mdash;which only goes to show that
      Rowdy Vaughan was a born optimist.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Silent One complained that he could not keep supplied with
      reading-matter, and Pink bewailed the monotony of inaction. For, beyond
      watching the river to keep the cattle from miring in the mud lately
      released from frost grip, there was nothing to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the calendar, spring was well upon them, and the prairies
      would soon be flaunting new dresses of green. The calendar, however, had
      neglected to record the rainless heat of the summer gone before, or the
      searing winds that burned the grass brown as it grew, or the winter which
      forgot its part and permitted prairie-dogs to chip-chip-chip above ground
      in January, when they should be sleeping decently in their cellar homes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apart from the brief storm which Rowdy had brought with him, there had
      been no snow worth considering. Always the chill winds shaved the barren
      land from the north, or veered unexpectedly, and blew dry warmth from the
      southwest; but never the snow for which the land yearned. Wind, and bright
      sunlight, and more wind, and hypocritical, drifting clouds, and more sun;
      lean cattle walking, walking, up-hill and down coulee, nose to the dry
      ground, snipping the stray tufts where should be a woolly carpet of sweet,
      ripened grasses, eating wildrose bushes level with the sod, and wishing
      there was only an abundance even of them; drifting uneasily from hilltop
      to farther hilltop, hunger-driven and gaunt, where should be sleek
      content. When they sought to continue their quest beyond the river, and
      the weaker bogged at its muddy edge, Rowdy and Pink and the Silent One
      would ride out, and with their ropes drag them back ignominiously to solid
      ground and the very doubtful joy of living.
    </p>
    <p>
      May Day found the grass-land brown and lifeless, with a chill wind blowing
      over it. The cattle wandered as before except that knock-kneed little
      calves trailed beside their lean mothers and clamored for full stomachs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cross L cattle bore the brunt of the range famine, because Eagle Creek
      Smith was a stockman of the old school. His cattle must live on the open
      range, because they always had done so. Other men bought or leased large
      tracts of grass-land, and fenced them for just such an emergency, but not
      he. It is true that he had two or three large fields, as Miss Conroy had
      told Rowdy, but it was his boast that all the hay he raised was eaten by
      his saddlehorses, and that all the fields he owned were used solely for
      horse pastures. The open range was the place for cattle and no Cross L
      critter ever fed inside a wire fence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the dry summer before, when other men read the ominous signs and
      hurriedly leased pasture-land and cut down their herds to what the fields
      would feed, Eagle Creek went calmly on as he had done always. He shipped
      what beef was fit&mdash;and that, of a truth, was not much!&mdash;and
      settled down for the winter, trusting to winter snows and spring rains to
      refill the long-dry lakes and waterholes, and coat the levels anew with
      grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the winter snows had failed to appear, and with the spring came no
      rain. &ldquo;April showers&rdquo; became a hideously ironical joke at nature's
      expense. Always the wind blew, and sometimes great flocks of clouds would
      drift superciliously up from the far sky-line, play with men's hopes, and
      sail disdainfully on to some more favored land.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is all very well for a man to cling stubbornly to precedent, but if he
      clings long enough, there comes a time when to cling becomes akin to
      crime. Eagle Creek Smith still stubbornly held that rangecattle should be
      kept to the range. He waited until May was fast merging to June, watching,
      from sheer habit, for the spring transformation of brown prairies into
      green. When it did not come, and only the coulee sides and bottoms showed
      green among the brown, he accepted ruefully the unusual conditions which
      nature had thrust upon him, and started &ldquo;Wooden Shoes&rdquo; out with the wagons
      on the horse round-up, which is a preliminary to the roundup proper, as
      every one knows.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 6. A Shot From the Dark.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I call that a bad job well done,&rdquo; Pink remarked, after a long silence, as
      he gave over trying to catch a fish in the muddy Milk River.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; Rowdy, still prone to day-dreams of matters domestic, came back
      reluctantly to reality, and inspected his bait.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come alive! I mean the horse round-up. How we're going to keep that
      bunch uh skeletons under us all summer is a guessing contest for fair.
      Wooden Shoes has got t' give me about forty, instead of a dozen, if he
      wants me t' hit 'er up on circle the way I'm used to. I bet their
      back-bones'll wear clean up through our saddles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I guess not,&rdquo; said Rowdy calmly. &ldquo;They ain't so thin&mdash;and
      they'll pick up flesh. There's some mighty good ones in the bunch, too. I
      hope Wooden Shoes don't forget to give me the first pick. There's one I
      got my eye on&mdash;that blue roan. Anyway, I guess you can wiggle along
      with less than forty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pink shook his head thoughtfully and sighed. Pink loved good mounts, and
      the outlook did not please him. The round-up had camped, for the last
      time, on the river within easy riding distance of Camas. The next day's
      drive would bring them to the home ranch, where Eagle Creek was fuming
      over the lateness of the season, the condition of the range, and the June
      rains, which had thus far failed even to moisten decently the grass-roots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's ride over to Camas; all the other fellows have gone,&rdquo; Pink proposed
      listlessly, drawing in his line.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rowdy as listlessly consented. Camas as a town was neither interesting nor
      important; but when one has spent three long weeks communing with nature
      in her sulkiest and most unamiable mood, even a town without a railroad to
      its name may serve to relieve the monotony of living.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was piling gorgeous masses of purple and crimson clouds high about
      him, cuddling his fat cheeks against their soft folds till, a Midas, he
      turned them to gold at the touch. Those farther away gloomed jealously at
      the favoritism of their lord, and huddled closer together&mdash;the purple
      for rage, perhaps; and the crimson for shame!
    </p>
    <p>
      Pink's face was tinged daintily with the glow, and even Rowdy's lean,
      brown features were for the moment glorified. They rode knee to knee
      silently, thinking each his own thoughts the while they watched the sunset
      with eyes grown familiar with its barbaric splendor, but never
      indifferent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon the west held none but the deeper tints, and the shadows climbed,
      with the stealthy tread of trailing Indians, from the valley, chasing the
      after-glow to the very hilltops, where it stood a moment at bay and then
      surrendered meekly to the dusk. A meadow-lark near-by cut the silence into
      haunting ripples of melody, stopped affrighted at their coming, and flew
      off into the dull glow of the west; his little body showed black against a
      crimson cloud. Out across the river a lone coyote yapped sharply, then
      trailed off into the weird plaint of his kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brother-in-law's in town to-day; Bob Nevin saw him,&rdquo; Pink remarked, when
      the coyote ceased wailing and held his peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; Rowdy only half-heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bob Nevin,&rdquo; repeated Pink naively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't get funny. Who did Bob see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brother-in-law. Yours, not mine. Jessie's tin god. If he's there yet, I
      bid for an invite to the 'swatfest.' Or maybe&rdquo;&mdash;a horrible
      possibility forced itself upon Pink&mdash;&ldquo;maybe you'll kill the fattest
      maverick and fall on his neck&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The maverick's?&rdquo; Rowdy's brows were rather pinched together, but his tone
      told nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naw; Harry Conroy's a fellow's liable to do most any fool thing when he's
      got schoolma'amitis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pink snorted. The possibility had grown to black certainty in his mind. He
      became suddenly furious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord! I hope some kind friend'll lead me out an' knock me in the head, if
      ever I get locoed over any darned girl!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Same here,&rdquo; agreed Rowdy, unmoved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then your days are sure numbered in words uh one syllable, old-timer,&rdquo;
       snapped Pink.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rowdy leaned and patted him caressingly upon the shoulder&mdash;a form of
      irony which Pink detested. &ldquo;Don't get excited, sonny,&rdquo; he soothed. &ldquo;Did
      you fetch your gun?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sure did!&rdquo; Pink drew a long breath of relief. &ldquo;Yuh needn't think I'm
      going t' take chances on being no human colander. I've packed a gun for
      Harry Conroy ever since that rough-riding contest uh yourn. Yuh mind the
      way I took him under the ear with a rock? He's been makin' war-talk behind
      m' back ever since. Did I bring m' gun! Well, I guess yes!&rdquo; He dimpled
      distractingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the same, it'll suit me not to run up against him,&rdquo; said Rowdy quite
      frankly. He knew Pink would understand. Then he lifted his coat
      suggestively, to show the weapon concealed beneath, and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Different here. Yuh did have sense enough t' be ready&mdash;and if yuh
      see him, and don't forget he's got a sister with a number two foot, damned
      if I don't fix yuh both a-plenty!&rdquo; He settled his hat more firmly over his
      curls, and eyed Rowdy anxiously from under his lashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rowdy caught the action and the look from the tail of his eye, and grinned
      at his horse's ears. Pink in warlike mood always made him think of a
      four-year-old child playing pirate with the difference that Pink was
      always in deadly earnest and would fight like a fiend.
    </p>
    <p>
      For more reasons than one he hoped they would not meet Harry Conroy.
      Jessie was still in ignorance of his real attitude toward her brother, and
      Rowdy wanted nothing more than to keep her so. The trouble was that he was
      quite certain to forget everything but his grievances, if ever he came
      face to face with Harry. Also, Pink would always fight quicker for his
      friends than for himself, and he felt very tender toward Pink. So he hoped
      fervently that Harry Conroy had already ridden back whence he came, and
      there would be no unpleasantness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four or five Cross L horses stood meekly before the Come Again Saloon, so
      Rowdy and Pink added theirs to the gathering and went in. The Silent One
      looked up from his place at a round table in a far corner, and beckoned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We need another hand here,&rdquo; he said, when they went over to him. &ldquo;These
      gentlemen are worried because they might be taken into high society some
      day, and they would be placed in a very embarrassing position through
      their ignorance of bridge-whist. I have very magnanimously consented to
      teach them the rudiments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bob Nevin looked up, and then lowered an eyelid cautiously. &ldquo;He's a liar.
      He offered to learn us how to play it; we bet him the drinks he didn't
      savvy the game himself. Set down, Pink, and I'll have you for my pretty
      pardner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Silent One shuffled the cards thoughtfully. &ldquo;To make it seem like
      bona-fide bridge,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;we should have everybody playing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, the common, ordinary brand is good enough,&rdquo; protested Bob. &ldquo;I ain't
      in on any trimmings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Silent One smiled ever so slightly. &ldquo;We should have prizes&mdash;or
      favors. Is there a store in town where one could buy something suitable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They got codfish up here; I smelt it,&rdquo; suggested Jim Ellis. Him the
      Silent One ignored.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say, boys, to a real, high society whist-party? I'll invite
      the crowd, and be the hostess. And I'll serve punch&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on, fellows, and have one with me,&rdquo; called a strange voice near the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meeting's adjourned,&rdquo; cried Jim Ellis, and got up to accept the
      invitation and range along the bar with the rest. He had not been
      particularly interested in bridge-whist anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      The others remained seated, and the bartender called across to know what
      they would have. Pink cut the cards very carefully, and did not look up.
      Rowdy thrust both hands in his pockets and turned his square shoulder to
      the bar. He did not need to look&mdash;he knew that voice, with its shoddy
      heartiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Men began to observe his attitude, and looked at one another. When one is
      asked to drink with another, he must comply or decline graciously, if he
      would not give a direct insult.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry Conroy took three long steps and laid a hand on Rowdy's shoulder&mdash;a
      hand which Rowdy shook off as though it burned. &ldquo;Say, stranger, are you
      too high-toned t' drink with a common cowpuncher?&rdquo; he demanded sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rowdy half-turned toward him. &ldquo;No, sir. But I'll be mighty thirsty before
      I drink with you.&rdquo; His voice was even, but it cut.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room stilled on the instant; it was as if every man of them had turned
      to lay figures. Harry Conroy had winced at sight of Rowdy's face&mdash;men
      saw that, and some of them wondered. Pink leaned back in his chair, every
      nerve tightened for the next move, and waited. It was Harry&mdash;handsome,
      sneering, a certain swaggering defiance in his pose&mdash;who first spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's you, is it? I haven't saw yuh for some time. How's
      bronco-fighting? Gone up against any more contests?&rdquo; He laughed mockingly&mdash;with
      mouth and eyes maddeningly like Jessie's in teasing mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rowdy could have killed him for the resemblance alone. His lids drooped
      sleepily over eyes that glittered. Harry saw the sign, read it for danger;
      but he laughed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yuh ought to have seen this bronco-peeler pull leather, boys,&rdquo; he jeered
      recklessly &ldquo;I like to 'a' died. He got piled up the slickest I ever saw;
      and there was some feeble-minded Canucks had money up on him, too: He
      won't drink with me, 'cause I got off with the purse. He's got a grouch&mdash;and
      I don't know as I blame him; he did get let down pretty hard, for a fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe he did pull leather&mdash;but he didn't cut none, like you did, you
      damn' skunk!&rdquo; It was Pink&mdash;Pink, with big, long-lashed eyes purple
      with rage, and with a dead-white streak around his mouth, and a gun in his
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry wheeled toward him, and if a new light of fear crept into his eyes,
      his lips belied it in a sneer. &ldquo;Two of a kind!&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;So that's the
      story yuh brought over here, is it? Hell of a lot uh good it'll do yuh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Something in Pink's face warned Rowdy. Harry's face turned watchfully from
      one to the other. Evidently he considered Pink the more uncertain of the
      two; and he was quite justified in so thinking. Pink was only waiting for
      a cue before using his gun; and when Pink once began, there was no telling
      where or when he would leave off.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Harry stood uncertain, Rowdy's fist suddenly spatted against his
      cheek with considerable force. He tumbled, a cursing heap, against the
      foot-rail of the bar, scrambled up like a cat&mdash;a particularly vicious
      cat&mdash;and came at Rowdy murderously. The Come Again would shortly have
      been filled with the pungent haze of burned powder, only that the
      bartender was a man-of-action. He hated brawls, and it did not matter to
      him how just might be the quarrel; he slapped the gaping barrels of a
      sawed-off shotgun across the bar&mdash;and from the look of it one might
      imagine many disagreeable things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drop it! Cut it out!&rdquo; he bellowed. &ldquo;Yuh ain't going t' make no
      slaughter-pen out uh this joint, I tell yuh. Put up them guns or else take
      'em outside. If you fellers are hell-bent on smokin' each other up, they's
      all kinds uh room outdoors. Git! Vamose! Hike!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Conroy wheeled and walked, straight-backed and venomous, to the door.
      &ldquo;Come on out, if yuh ain't scared,&rdquo; he sneered. &ldquo;It's two agin' one and
      then some, by the look uh things. But I'll take yuh singly or in bunches.
      I'm ready for the whole damn' Cross L bunch uh coyotes. Come on, you
      white-livered&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rowdy rushed for him, with Pink and the Silent One at his heels. He had
      forgotten that Harry Conroy ever had a sister of any sort whatsoever. All
      he knew was that Harry had done him much wrong, of the sort which comes
      near to being unforgivable, and that he had sneered insults that no man
      may overlook. All he thought of was to get his hands on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside, the dusky stillness made all sounds seem out of place; the faint
      starlight made all objects black and unfamiliar. Rowdy stopped, just off
      the threshold, blinking at the darkness which held his enemy. It was
      strange that he did not find him at his elbow, he thought&mdash;and a
      suspicion came to him that Harry was lying in wait; it would be like him.
      He stepped out of the yellow glare from a window and stood in more
      friendly shade. Behind him, on the door-step, stood the other two,
      blinking as he had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      A form which he did not recognize rushed up out of the darkness and
      confronted the three belligerently. &ldquo;You're a-disturbin' the peace,&rdquo; he
      yelled. &ldquo;We don't stand for nothing like that in Camas. You're my
      prisoners&mdash;all uh yuh.&rdquo; The edict seemed to include even the
      bartender, peering over the shoulder of Bob Nevin, who struggled with
      several others for immediate passage through the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess not, pardner,&rdquo; retorted Pink, facing him as defiantly as though
      the marshal were not twice his size.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marshal lunged for him; but the Silent One, reaching a long arm from
      the door-step, rapped him smartly on the head with his gun. The marshal
      squawked and went down in a formless heap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on, boys,&rdquo; said the Silent One coolly. &ldquo;I think we'd better go. Your
      friend seems to have vanished in thin air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rowdy, grumbling mightily over what looked unpleasantly like retreat, was
      pushed toward his horse and mounted under protest. Likewise Pink, who was
      for staying and cleaning up the whole town. But the Silent One was firm,
      and there was that in his manner which compelled obedience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry Conroy might have been an optical&mdash;and aural&mdash;illusion,
      for all the trace there was of him. But when the three rode out into the
      little street, a bullet pinged close to Rowdy's left ear, and the red bark
      of a revolver spat viciously from a black shadow beside the Come Again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rowdy and the two turned and rode back, shooting blindly at the place, but
      the shadow yawned silently before them and gave no sign. Then the Silent
      One, observing that the marshal was getting upon a pair of very unsteady
      legs, again assumed the leadership, and fairly forced Rowdy and Pink into
      the homeward trail.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 7. Rowdy in a Tough Place.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Rowdy, with nice calculation, met Miss Conroy just as she had left the
      school-house, and noted with much satisfaction that she was riding alone.
      Miss Conroy, if she had been at all observant, must have seen the light of
      some fixed purpose shining in his eyes; for Rowdy was resolved to make her
      a partner in his dreams of matters domestic. And, of a truth, his easy
      assurance was the thinnest of cloaks to hide his inner agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The round-up just got in yesterday afternoon,&rdquo; he told her, as he swung
      into the trail beside her. &ldquo;We're going to start out again to-morrow, so
      this is about the only chance I'll have to see you for a while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew the round-up must be in,&rdquo; said Miss Conroy calmly. &ldquo;I heard that
      you were in Camas a night or two ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Inwardly, Rowdy dodged. &ldquo;We camped close to Camas,&rdquo; he conceded guardedly.
      &ldquo;A lot of us fellows rode into town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, so Harry told me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He came over to see me yesterday. He
      is going to leave&mdash;has already, in fact. He has had a fine position
      offered him by the Indian agent at Belknap. The agent used to be a friend
      of father's.&rdquo; She looked at Rowdy sidelong, and then went straight at what
      was in the minds of both.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry to hear, Mr. Vaughan, that you are on bad terms with Harry.
      What was the trouble?&rdquo; She turned her head and smiled at him&mdash;but the
      smile did not bring his lips to answer; it was unpleasantly like the way
      Harry smiled when he had some deviltry in mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rowdy scented trouble and parried. &ldquo;Men can't always get along agreeably
      together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you disagree with a man rather emphatically, I should judge. Harry
      said you knocked him down.&rdquo; Politeness ruled her voice, but cheeks and
      eyes were aflame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did. And of course he told you how he took a shot at me from a dark
      corner, outside.&rdquo; Rowdy's eyes, it would seem, had kindled from the fire
      in hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he didn't&mdash;but I&mdash;you struck him first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hitting a man with your fist is one thing,&rdquo; said Rowdy with decision.
      &ldquo;Shooting at him from ambush is another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harry shouldn't have done that,&rdquo; she admitted with dignity. &ldquo;But why
      wouldn't you take a drink with him? Not that I approve of drinking&mdash;I
      wish Harry wouldn't do such things&mdash;but he said it was an insult the
      way you refused.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jessie&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Conroy, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jessie&rdquo;&mdash;he repeated the name stubbornly&mdash;&ldquo;I think we'd better
      drop that subject. You don't understand the case; and, anyway, I didn't
      come here to discuss Harry. Our trouble is long standing, and if I
      insulted him you ought to know I had a reason. I never came whining to you
      about him, and it don't speak well for him that he hot-footed over to you
      with his version. I suppose he'd heard about me&mdash;er&mdash;going to
      see you, and wanted to queer me. I hope you'll take my word for it,
      Jessie, that I've never harmed him; all the trouble he's made for himself,
      one way and another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what I came over for to-day concerns just you and me. I wanted to
      tell you that&mdash;to ask you if you'll marry me. I might put it more
      artistic, Jessie, but that's what I mean, and&mdash;I mean all the things
      I'd like to say and can't.&rdquo; He stopped and smiled at her, wistfully
      whimsical. &ldquo;I've been three weeks getting my feelings into proper words,
      little girl, and coming over here I had a speech thought out that sure
      done justice to my subject. But all I can remember of it is just that&mdash;that
      I want you for always.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Conroy looked away from him, but he could see a deeper tint of red in
      her cheek. It seemed a long time before she said anything. Then: &ldquo;But
      you've forgotten about Harry. He's my brother, and he'd be&mdash;er&mdash;you
      wouldn't want him related&mdash;to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harry! Well, I pass him up. I've got a pretty long account against him;
      but I'll cross it off. It won't be hard to do&mdash;for you. I've thought
      of all that; and a man can forgive a whole lot in the brother of the woman
      he loves.&rdquo; He leaned toward her and added honestly: &ldquo;I can't promise you
      I'll ever get to like him, Jessie; but I'll keep my hands off him, and
      I'll treat him civil; and when you consider all he's done, that's quite a
      large-sized contract.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Conroy became much interested in the ears of her horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The only thing to decide is whether you like me enough. If you do, we'll
      sure be happy. Never mind Harry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're very generous,&rdquo; she flared, &ldquo;telling me to never mind Harry. And
      Harry's my own brother, and the only near relative I've got. I know he's&mdash;impulsive,
      and quick-tempered, perhaps. But he needs me all the more. Do you think
      I'll turn against him, even for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That &ldquo;even&rdquo; may have been a slip, but it heartened Rowdy immensely. &ldquo;I
      don't ask you to,&rdquo; he told her gently. &ldquo;I only want you to not turn
      against me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do wish you two would be sensible, and stop quarreling.&rdquo; She glanced at
      him briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm willing to cut it out&mdash;I told you that. I can't answer for him,
      though.&rdquo; Rowdy sighed, wishing Harry Conroy in Australia, or some place
      equally remote.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Conroy suddenly resolved to be strictly just; and when a young woman
      sets about being deliberately just, the Lord pity him whom she judges!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before I answer you, I must know just what all this is about,&rdquo; she said
      firmly. &ldquo;I want to hear both sides; I'm sure Harry wouldn't do anything
      mean. Do you think he would?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rowdy was dissentingly silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really, in your heart, believe that Harry would&mdash;knowingly&mdash;be
      guilty of anything mean?&rdquo; Her eyes plainly told the answer she wanted to
      hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rowdy looked into them, hesitated, and clung tenaciously to his
      convictions. &ldquo;Yes, I do; and I know Harry pretty well, Jessie.&rdquo; His face
      showed how much he hated to say it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid you are very prejudiced,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;But go on; tell me just
      what you have against Harry. I'm sure it can all be explained away, only I
      must hear what it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rowdy regarded her, puzzled. How he was to comply he did not know. It
      would be simply brutal to tell her. He would feel like a hangman. And she
      believed so in Harry, she wouldn't listen; even if she did, he thought
      bitterly, she would hate him for destroying her faith. A woman's justice&mdash;ah,
      me!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you see you're putting me in a mighty hard position, girlie?&rdquo; he
      protested. &ldquo;You're a heap better off not to know. He's your brother. I
      wish you'd take my word that I'll drop the whole thing right where it is.
      Harry's had all the best of it, so far; let it stand that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes met his coldly. &ldquo;Are you afraid to let me judge between you? What
      did he do? Daren't you tell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rowdy's lids drooped ominously. &ldquo;If you call that a dare,&rdquo; he said grimly,
      &ldquo;I'll tell you, fast enough. I was a friend to him when he needed one
      mighty bad. I helped him when he was dead broke and out uh work. I kept
      him going all winter&mdash;and to show his gratitude, he gave me the
      doublecross, in more ways than one. I won't go into details.&rdquo; He decided
      that he simply could not tell her bluntly that Harry had worked off stolen
      horses on him, and worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;you won't go into details!&rdquo; Scorn filled eyes and voice. &ldquo;Are
      they so trivial, then? You tell me what you did for Harry&mdash;playing
      Good Samaritan. Harry, let me tell you, has property of his own; I can't
      see why he should ever be in need of charity. You're like all the rest;
      you hint things against him&mdash;but I believe it's just jealousy. You
      can't come out honestly and tell me a single instance where he has harmed
      you, or done anything worse than other high-spirited young men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wouldn't do any good to tell you,&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;You think he's just
      lacking wings to be an angel. I hope to God you'll always be able to think
      so! I'm sure I don't want to jar your faith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must say your actions don't bear out your words. You've just been
      trying to turn me against him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't. I've been trying to convince you that I want you, anyway, and
      Harry needn't come between us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In other words, you're willing to overlook my being Harry's sister. I
      appreciate your generosity, I'm sure.&rdquo; She did not look, however, as if
      she meant that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't mean that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you won't overlook it? How very unfortunate! Because I can't help
      the relationship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you, if you could?&rdquo; he asked rashly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid we're getting off the trail,&rdquo; he amended tactfully. &ldquo;I asked
      you, a while back, if you'd marry me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I said I must hear both sides of your trouble with Harry, before I
      could answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the use? You'd take his part, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if I found he was guilty of all you&mdash;insinuate. I should be
      perfectly just.&rdquo; She really believed that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't you tell me yes or no, anyway? Don't let him come between us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't help it. We'd never agree, or be happy. He'd keep on coming
      between us, whether we meant him to or not,&rdquo; she said dispiritedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a cinch,&rdquo; Rowdy muttered, thinking of Harry's trouble-breeding
      talents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there's no more to be said. Until you and Harry settle your
      difficulties amicably, or I am convinced that he's in the wrong, we'll
      just be friends, Mr. Vaughan. Good afternoon.&rdquo; She rode into the Rodway
      yard, feeling very just and virtuous, no doubt. But she left Rowdy with
      some rather unpleasant thoughts, and with a sentiment toward her precious
      brother which was not far from manslaughter.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 8. Pink in a Threatening Mood.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Eagle Creek Smith had at last reached the point where he must face new
      conditions and change established customs. He could no longer ignore the
      barrenness of the range, or close his eyes to the grim fact that his
      cattle were facing starvation&mdash;and that in June, when they should be
      taking on flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he finally did confess to himself that things couldn't go on like
      that, others had been before him in leasing and buying land, until only
      the dry benches were left to him and his hungry herds.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Eagle Creek was a man of resource. When the round-up pulled in and
      Wooden Shoes reported to him the general state of the cattle, and told of
      the water-holes newly fenced and of creek bottoms gobbled by men more
      farseeing than he, Eagle Creek took twenty-four hours to adjust himself to
      the situation and to meet the crisis before him. His own land, as compared
      to his twenty thousand cattle, was too pitifully inadequate for a second
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      He must look elsewhere for the correct answer to his problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Rowdy rode apathetically up to the stable, Pink came out of the
      bunk-house to meet him, big with news. &ldquo;Oh, doctor! We're up against it
      a-plenty now,&rdquo; he greeted, with his dimples at their deepest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; grunted Rowdy crossly. &ldquo;What's hurting you, Pink?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forecasting the future,&rdquo; Pink retorted. &ldquo;Eagle Creek has come alive, and
      has wised up sudden to the fact that this ain't going t' be any Noah's
      flood brand uh summer, and that his cattle look like the tailings of a
      wash-board factory. He's got busy&mdash;and we're sure going to. We're due
      t' hit the grit out uh here in the first beams uh rosy morn, and do a
      record stunt at gathering cattle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we were going to, anyhow,&rdquo; Rowdy cut in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that's only the prelude, old-timer. We've got t' take 'em across
      country to the Belknap reservation. Eagle Creek went t' town and
      telegraphed, and got the refusal of it for pasturage; he ain't so slow,
      oncet he gets started. But if you've ever rode over them dried-up benches,
      you savvy the merry party we'll be when we git there. I've saw
      jack-rabbits packing their lunch along over there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Belknap&rdquo;&mdash;Rowdy dropped his saddle spitefully to the ground&mdash;&ldquo;is
      where our friend Conroy has just gone to fill a splendid position.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pink thoughtfully blew the ashes from his cigarette. &ldquo;Harry Conroy would
      fill one position fine. So one uh these days I'll offer it to him. I don't
      know anybody that'd look nicer in a coffin than that jasper&mdash;and if
      he's gone t' Belknap, that's likely the position he'll fill, all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rowdy said nothing, but his very silence told Pink much.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How'd yuh make out with Jessie?&rdquo; Pink asked frankly, though he was not
      supposed to know where Rowdy had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rowdy knew from experience that it was useless trying to keep anything
      from Pink that Pink wanted to know; besides, there was a certain comfort
      in telling his troubles to so stanch a friend. &ldquo;Harry got his work in
      there, too,&rdquo; he said bitterly. &ldquo;He beat me to her and queered me for good,
      by the looks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; said Pink. &ldquo;I wouldn't waste much time worrying over her, if she's
      that easy turned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's all right,&rdquo; defended Rowdy quickly. &ldquo;I don't know as I blame her;
      she takes the stand any sister would take. She wants to know all about the
      trouble&mdash;hear both sides, she said, so she could judge which was to
      blame. I guess she's got her heart set on being peacemaker. I know one
      thing: she&mdash;likes me, all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see how he queered yuh any, then,&rdquo; puzzled Pink. &ldquo;She sure
      couldn't take his part after you'd told her all he done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rowdy turned on him savagely. &ldquo;You little fool, do you think I told her?
      Right there's the trouble. He told his story; and when she asked for mine,
      I couldn't say anything. She's his sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;didn't&mdash;tell!&rdquo; Pink leaned against the stable and stared.
      &ldquo;Rowdy Vaughan, there's times when even your friend can't disguise the
      fact that yuh act plumb batty. Yuh let Harry do yuh dirt that any other
      man'd 'a' killed him on bare suspicion uh doing; and yuh never told her
      when she asked yuh to! How yuh lent him money, and let him steal some
      right out uh your pocket&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't prove that,&rdquo; Rowdy objected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yuh never told her about his cutting your latigo&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, cut it out!&rdquo; Rowdy glowered down at him. &ldquo;I guess I don't need to be
      reminded of all those things. But are they the things a man can tell a
      girl about her brother? Pink, you're about as unfeeling a little devil as
      I ever run across. Maybe you'd have told her; but I couldn't. So it's all
      off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned away and stared unseeingly at the rim of hills that hid the
      place where she lived. She seemed very far away from him just then&mdash;and
      very, very desirable. He thought then that he had never before realized
      just how much he cared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can jest bet I'd 'a' told her!&rdquo; gritted Pink, watching furtively
      Rowdy's averted face. &ldquo;She ain't goin' t' be bowed down by no load of
      ignorance much longer, either. If she don't get Harry Conroy's pedigree
      straight out, without the varnish, it'll be because I ain't next to all
      his past.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Rowdy, glooming among the debris of certain pet air-castles, neither
      heard nor wanted to hear Pink's wrathful mutterings. As a matter of fact,
      it was not till Pink clattered out of the yard on Mascot that he
      remembered where he was. Even then it did not occur to him to wonder where
      Pink was going.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 9. Moving the Herd.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Four thousand weary cattle crawled up the long ridge which divides Chin
      Coulee from Quitter Creek. Pink, riding point, opposite the Silent One,
      twisted round in his saddle and looked back at the slow-moving river of
      horns and backs veiled in a gray dust-cloud. Down the line at intervals
      rode the others, humped listlessly in their saddles, their hat brims
      pulled low over tired eyes that smarted with dust and wind and burning
      heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pink sighed, and wished lonesomely that it was Rowdy riding point with
      him, instead of the Silent One, who grew even more silent as the day
      dragged leadenly to mid-afternoon; Pink could endure anything better than
      being left to his thoughts and to the complaining herd for company.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took off his hat, pushed back his curls&mdash;dripping wet they were
      and flattened unbecomingly in pasty, yellow rings on his forehead&mdash;and
      eyed with disfavor a line-backed, dry cow, with one horn tipped rakishly
      toward her speckled nose; she blinked silently at wind and heat, and
      forged steadily ahead, up-hill and down coulee, always in the lead, always
      walking, walking, like an automaton. Her energy, in the face of all the
      dry, dreary days, rasped Pink's nerves unbearably. For nearly a week he
      had ridden left point, and always that line-backed cow with the
      down-crumpled horn walked and walked and walked, a length ahead of her
      most intrepid followers.
    </p>
    <p>
      He leaned from his saddle, picked up a rock from the barren, yellow
      hillside, and threw it at the cow spitefully. The rock bounced off her
      lean rump; she blinked and broke into a shuffling trot, her dragging hoofs
      kicking up an extra amount of dust, which blew straight into Pink's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, cut it out!&rdquo; he shouted petulantly. &ldquo;You're sure the limit, without
      doing any stunts at sprinting up-hill. Ain't yuh got any nerves, yuh
      blamed old skate? Yuh act like it was milkin'-time, and yuh was headed
      straight for the bars and a bran mash. Can't yuh realize the kind uh deal
      you're up against? Here's cattle that's got you skinned for looks, old
      girl, and they know it's coming blamed tough; and you just bat your eyes
      and peg along like yuh enjoyed it. Bawl, or something, can't yuh? Drop
      back a foot and act human!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Silent One looked across at him with a tired smile. &ldquo;Let her go, Pink,
      and pray for more like her,&rdquo; he called amusedly. &ldquo;There'll be enough of
      them dropping back presently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pink threw one leg over the horn and rode sidewise, made him a cigarette,
      and tried to forget the cow&mdash;or, at least, to forgive her for not
      acting as dog-tired as he felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were on the very peak of the ridge now, and the hill sloped smoothly
      down before them to the bluff which bounded Quitter Creek. Far down, a
      tiny black speck in the coulee-bottom, they could see Wooden Shoes riding
      along the creek-bank, scouting for water. From the way he rode, and from
      the fact that camp was nowhere in sight, Pink guessed shrewdly that his
      quest was in vain. He shrugged his shoulders at what that meant, and gave
      his attention to the herd.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marching line split at the brow of the bluff. The line-backed cow
      lowered her head a bit and went unfaltering down the parched,
      gravel-coated hill, followed by a few hundred of the freshest. Then the
      stream stopped flowing, and Pink and the Silent One rode back up the bluff
      to where the bulk of the footsore herd, their senses dulled by hunger and
      weariness and choking thirst, sniffed at the gravel that promised agony to
      their bruised feet, and balked at the ordeal. Others straggled up, bunched
      against the rebels, and stood stolidly where they were.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pink galloped on down the crawling line. &ldquo;Forward, the Standard Oil
      Brigade!&rdquo; he yelled whimsically as he went.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cowboys heard&mdash;and understood. They left their places and went
      forward at a lope, and Pink rode back to the coulee edge, untying his
      slicker as he went. The Silent One was already off his horse and shouting
      hoarsely as he whacked with his slicker at the sulky mass. Pink rode in
      and did the same. It was not the first time this thing had happened, and
      from a diversion it was verging closely on the monotonous. Presently, even
      a rank tenderfoot must have caught the significance of Pink's military
      expression. The Standard Oil Brigade was at the front in force.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cowboys, swinging five-gallon oil-cans, picked up from scattered sheep
      camps and carried many a weary mile for just such an emergency, were
      charging the bunch intrepidly. Others made shift with flat sirup-cans with
      pebbles inside. A few, like Pink and the Silent One, flapped their
      slickers till their arms ached. Anything, everything that would make a din
      and startle the cattle out of their lethargy, was pressed into service.
    </p>
    <p>
      But they might have been raised in a barnyard and fed cabbage leaves from
      back door-steps, for all the excitement they showed. Cattle that three
      months ago&mdash;or a month&mdash;would run, head and tail high in air, at
      sight of a man on foot, backed away from a rattling, banging cube of
      gleaming tin, turned and faced the thing dull-eyed and apathetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      In time, however, they gave way dogedly before the onslaught. A few were
      forced shrinkingly down the hill; others followed gingerly, until the line
      lengthened and flowed, a sluggish, brown-red stream, into the coulee and
      across to Quitter Creek.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the leaders were browsing greedily along the banks. They had emptied
      the few holes that had still held a meager store of brackish water and so
      the mutinous bulk of the herd snuffed at the trampled, muddy spots and
      bellowed their disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wooden Shoes rode up and surveyed the half maddened animals gloomily.
      &ldquo;Push 'em on, boys,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They's nothings for 'em here. I've sent the
      wagons on to Red Willow; we'll try that next. Push 'em along all yuh can,
      while I go on ahead and see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With tin-cans, slickers, and much vituperation, they forced the herd up
      the coulee side and strung them out again on trail. The line-backed cow
      walked and walked in the lead before Pink's querulous gaze, and the others
      plodded listlessly after. The gray dust-cloud formed anew over their
      slowmoving backs, and the cowboys humped over in their saddles and rode
      and rode, with the hot sun beating aslant in their dirt-grimed faces, and
      with the wind blowing and blowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      If this had been the first herd to make that dreary trip, things would not
      have been quite so disheartening. But it was the third. Seven thousand
      lean kine had passed that way before them, eating the scant grass growth
      and drinking what water they could find among those barren, sun-baked
      coulees.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cross L boys, on this third trip, were become a jaded lot of
      hollow-eyed men, whose nerves were rasped raw with long hours and longer
      days in the saddle. Pink's cheeks no longer made his name appropriate, and
      he was not the only one who grew fretful over small things. Rowdy had been
      heard, more than once lately, to anathematize viciously the prairie-dogs
      for standing on their tails and chipchip-chipping at them as they went by.
      And though the Silent One did not swear, he carried rocks in his pockets,
      and threw them with venomous precision at every &ldquo;dog&rdquo; that showed his
      impertinent nose out of a burrow within range. For Pink, he vented his
      spleen on the line-backed cow.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they walked and walked and walked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cattle balked at another hill, and all the tincans and slickers in the
      crowd could scarcely move them. The wind dropped with the sun, and the
      clouds glowed gorgeously above them, getting scant notice, except that
      they told eloquently of the coming night; and there were yet miles&mdash;long,
      rough, heartbreaking miles&mdash;to put behind them before they could hope
      for the things their tired bodies craved: supper and dreamless sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the last of the herd had sidled, under protest, down the long hill to
      the flat, dusk was pushing the horizon closer upon them, mile by mile.
      When they crawled sinuously out upon the welcome level, the hill loomed
      ghostly and black behind them. A mile out, Wooden Shoes rode out of the
      gloom and met the point. He turned and rode beside Pink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yuh'll have t' swing 'em north,&rdquo; he greeted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Red Willow's dry as hell&mdash;all but in the Rockin' R field. No use
      askin' ole Mullen to let us in there; we'll just go. I sent the wagons
      through the fence, an' yuh'll find camp about a mile up from the mouth uh
      the big coulee. You swing 'em round the end uh this bench, an' hit that
      big coulee at the head. When you come t' the fence, tear it down. They's
      awful good grass in that field!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Pink cheerfully. It was in open defiance of range
      etiquette; but their need was desperate. The only thing about it Pink did
      not like was the long detour they must make. He called the news across to
      the Silent One, after Wooden Shoes had gone on down the line, and they
      swung the point gradually to the left.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before that drive was over, Pink had vowed many times to leave the range
      forever and never to turn another cow&mdash;besides a good many other
      foolish things which would be forgotten, once he had a good sleep. And
      Rowdy, plodding half-way down the herd, had grown exceedingly pessimistic
      regarding Jessie Conroy, and decided that there was no sense in thinking
      about her all the time, the way he had been doing. Also, he told himself
      savagely that if Harry ever crossed his trail again, there would be
      something doing. This thing of letting a cur like that run roughshod over
      a man on account of a girl that didn't care was plumb idiotic. And beside
      him the cattle walked and walked and walked, a dim, moving mass in the
      quiet July night.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 10. Harry Conroy at Home.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was late next morning when they got under way; for they had not reached
      camp until long after midnight, and Wooden Shoes was determined the cattle
      should have one good feed, and all the water they wanted, to requite them
      for the hard drive of the day before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pink rode out with Rowdy to the herd&mdash;a heavylidded, gloomy Rowdy he
      was, and not amiably inclined toward the small talk of the range. But Pink
      had slept five whole hours and was almost his normal self; which means
      that speech was not to be denied him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What yuh mourning over?&rdquo; he bantered. &ldquo;Mad 'cause the reservation's so
      close?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; assented Rowdy, with deep sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what I thought. Studying up the nicest way uh giving
      brother-in-law the glad hand, ain't yuh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's no relation uh mine&mdash;and never will be,&rdquo; said Rowdy curtly.
      &ldquo;And I'll thank you, Pink, to drop that subject for good and all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down she goes,&rdquo; assented Pink, quite unperturbed. &ldquo;But the cards ain't
      all turned yet, yuh want to remember, I wouldn't pass on no hand like
      you've got. If I wanted a girl right bad, Rowdy, I'd wait till I got
      refused before I'd quit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems to me you've changed your politics lately,&rdquo; Rowdy retorted. &ldquo;A
      while back you was cussing the whole business; and now you're worse than
      an old maid aunt. Pink, you may not be wise to the fact, but you sure are
      an inconsistent little devil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are yuh going t' hunt Harry up and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I told you to drop that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did yuh? All right, then&mdash;only I hope yuh didn't leave your gun
      packed away in your bed,&rdquo; he insinuated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can take a look to-night, if you want to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pink laughed in a particularly infectious way he had, and, before he quite
      knew it, Rowdy was laughing, also. After that the world did not look quite
      so forlorn as it had, nor the day's work so distasteful. So Pink, having
      accomplished his purpose, was content to turn the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's old Liney&rdquo;&mdash;he pointed her out to Rowdy&mdash;&ldquo;fresh as a
      meadow-lark. I had a big grouch against her yesterday, just because she
      batted her eyes and kept putting one foot ahead uh the other. I could 'a'
      killed her. But she's all right, that old girl. The way she led out down
      that black coulee last night wasn't slow! Say, she's an ambitious old
      party. I wish you was riding point with me, Rowdy. The Silent One talks
      just about as much as that old cow. He sure loves to live up to his rep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, go on to work,&rdquo; Rowdy admonished. &ldquo;You make me think of a magpie.&rdquo;
       All the same, he looked after him with smiling lips, and eyes that forgot
      their gloom. He even whistled while he helped round up the scattered herd,
      ready for that last day's drive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every man in the outfit comforted himself with the thought that it was the
      last day's drive. After long weeks of trailing lean herds over barren,
      windbrushed hills, the last day meant much to them. Even the Silent One
      sang something they had never heard before, about &ldquo;If Only I Knew You Were
      True.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They crossed the Rocking R field, took down four panels of fence, passed
      out, and carefully put them up again behind them. Before them stretched
      level plain for two miles; beyond that a high, rocky ridge that promised
      some trouble with the herd, and after that more plain and a couleee or
      two, and then, on a far slope&mdash;the reservation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cattle were rested and fed, and walked out briskly; the ridge neared
      perceptibly. Pink's shrill whistle carried far back down the line and
      mingled pleasantly with voices calling to one another across the herd. Not
      a man was humped listlessly in his saddle; instead, they rode with
      shoulders back and hats at divers jaunty angles to keep the sun from
      shining in eyes that faced the future cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      The herd steadily climbed the ridge, choosing the smoothest path and the
      easiest slope. Pink assured the line-backed cow that she was a peach, and
      told her to &ldquo;go to it, old girl.&rdquo; The Silent One's pockets were quite
      empty of rocks, and the prairiedogs chipped and flirted their funny little
      tails unassailed. And Rowdy, from wondering what had made Pink change his
      attitude so abruptly, began to plan industriously the next meeting with
      Jessie Conroy, and to build a new castle that was higher and airier than
      any he had ever before attempted&mdash;and perhaps had a more flimsy
      foundation; for it rested precariously on Pink's idle remarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The point gained the top of the ridge, and Pink turned and swung his hat
      jubilantly at the others. The reservation was in sight, though it lay
      several miles distant. But in that clear air one could distinguish the
      line fence&mdash;if one had the eye of faith and knew just where to look.
      Presently he observed a familiar horseman climbing the ridge to meet them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eagle Creek's coming,&rdquo; he shouted to the man behind. &ldquo;Come alive, there,
      and don't let 'em roam all over the map. Git some style on yuh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Those who heard laughed; no one ever dreamed of being offended at what
      Pink said. Those who had not heard had the news passed on to them, in
      various forms. Wooden Shoes, who had been loitering in the rear gossiping
      with the men, rode on to meet Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eagle Creek urged his horse up the last steep place, right in the face of
      the leaders, which halted and tried to turn back. Pink, swearing in a
      whisper, began to force them forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let 'em alone,&rdquo; Eagle Creek bellowed harshly. &ldquo;They ain't goin' no
      farther.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W-what?&rdquo; Pink stopped short and eyed him critically. Eagle Creek could
      not justly be called a teetotaler; but Pink had never known him to get
      worse than a bit wobbly in his legs; his mind had never fogged
      perceptibly. Still, something was wrong with him, that was certain. Pink
      glanced dubiously across at the Silent One and saw him shrug his shoulders
      expressively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eagle Creek rode up and stopped within ten feet of the line-backed cow;
      she seemed hurt at being held up in this manner, Pink thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yuh'll have t' turn this herd back,&rdquo; Eagle Creek announced bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where to?&rdquo; Pink asked, too stunned to take in the meaning of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;T' hell, I guess. It's the only place I know of where everybody's
      welcome.&rdquo; Eagle Creek's tone was not pleasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We just came from there,&rdquo; Pink said simply, thinking of the horrors of
      that drive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's Wooden Shoes?&rdquo; snapped the old man; and the foreman's hat-crown
      appeared at that instant over the ridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we're up against it,&rdquo; Eagle Creek greeted. &ldquo;That damn' agent&mdash;or
      the fellow he had workin' for him&mdash;reported his renting us pasture.
      Made the report read about twice as many as we're puttin' on. He's got
      orders now t' turn out every hoof but what b'longs there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Lord!&rdquo; Wooden Shoes gasped at the catastrophe which faced the Cross L.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's Harry Conroy's work,&rdquo; Pink cut in sharply' &ldquo;He'd hurt the Cross L
      if he could, t' spite me and Rowdy. He&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't matter&mdash;seein' it's done. Yuh might as well turn the herd
      loose right here, an' let 'em go t' the devil. I don't know what else t'
      do with 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything gone wrong?&rdquo; It was Rowdy, who had left his place and ridden
      forward to see what was holding the herd back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naw. We're fired off the reservation, is all. We got orders to take the
      herd to hell. Eagle Creek's leased it. Mr. Satan is going to keep house
      here in Montana; he says it's better for his trade,&rdquo; Pink informed him, in
      his girlish treble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eagle Creek turned on him fiercely, then thought better of it and grinned.
      &ldquo;Them arrangements wouldn't make us any worse off'n what we are,&rdquo; he
      commented. &ldquo;Turn 'em loose, boys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man, if yuh turn 'em loose here, the first storm that hits 'em, they all
      die,&rdquo; Wooden Shoes interposed excitedly. &ldquo;They ain't nothings for 'em. We
      had t' turn 'em into the Rockin' R field last night, t' git water an'
      feed. Red Willow's gone dry outside dat field. They ain't&mdash;nothings.
      They'll die!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eagle Creek looked at him dully. For the first time in his life he faced
      utter ruin. &ldquo;Damn 'em, let 'em die, then!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what they'll sure do,&rdquo; Wooden Shoes reiterated stubbornly. &ldquo;If
      they don't git feed and water now, yuh needn't start no round-up next
      spring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pink's eyes went down over the close-huddled backs and the thicket of
      polished horns, and his eyelids stung. Would all of them die, he wondered!
      Four thousand! He hoped not. There must be some way out. Down the hill, he
      knew the cowboys were making cigarettes while they waited and wondered
      mightily what it was all about If they only knew, he thought, there would
      be more than one rope ready for Harry Conroy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about the Peck reservation? Couldn't you get them on there?&rdquo; Rowdy
      ventured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a hoof!&rdquo; growled Eagle Creek, with his chin sunk against his chest.
      &ldquo;There's thirty thousand Valley County cattle on there now.&rdquo; He looked
      down at the cattle, as Pink had done. &ldquo;God! It's bad enough t' go broke,&rdquo;
       he groaned; &ldquo;but t' think uh them poor brutes dyin' off in bunches, for
      want uh grass an' water! I've run that brand fer over thirty year.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 11. Rowdy Promoted.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Rowdy rode closer. &ldquo;If you don't mind paying duty,&rdquo; he began tentatively,
      &ldquo;I can put you next to a range over the line, where I'll guarantee feed
      and water the year round for every hoof you own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eagle Creek lifted his head and looked at him &ldquo;Whereabouts?&rdquo; he demanded
      skeptically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up in the Red Deer country. Pink knows the place. There's range a-plenty,
      and creeks running through that never go dry; and the country isn't
      stocked and fenced to death, like this is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And would we be ordered off soon as we got there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure not&mdash;if you paid duty, which would only be about double what
      you were going to pay for one year's pasture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eagle Creek breathed deeply, like a man who has narrowly escaped
      suffocation. &ldquo;Young man, I b'lieve you're a square dealer, and that yuh
      savvy the cow business. I've thought it ever since yuh started t' work.&rdquo;
       His keen old eyes twinkled at the memory of Rowdy's arrival, and Rowdy
      grinned. &ldquo;I take yuh at your word, and yuh can consider yourself in charge
      uh this herd as it stands. Take it t' that cow heaven yuh tell about&mdash;and
      damn it, yuh won't be none the worse for it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll pass that up,&rdquo; said Rowdy quietly. &ldquo;I'll take the herd through,
      though; and I'd advise you to get the rest on the road as soon as they can
      be gathered. It's a three-hundred-mile drive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. From now on it's up to you,&rdquo; Eagle Creek told him briskly.
      &ldquo;Take 'em back t' the Rockin' R field, and I'll send the wagons back t'
      you. Old Mullen'll likely make a roar&mdash;but that's most all gove'ment
      land he's got fenced, so I guess I can calm him down. Will yuh go near the
      ranch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; said Rowdy. &ldquo;It will be the shortest way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll give yuh some blank checks, an' you can load up with grub and
      anything else yuh need. I'll be over there by the time you are, and fix up
      that duty business. Wooden Shoes'll have t' get another outfit together,
      and get another bunch on the trail. One good thing&mdash;I got thirty days
      t' get off what cattle is on there; and thirty days uh grass and water'll
      put 'em in good shape for the trip. Wish this bunch was as well fixed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what,&rdquo; Rowdy assented. &ldquo;But I think they'll make it, all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll likely want yuh to stay up there and keep cases on 'em. Any
      objections?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure not!&rdquo; laughed Rowdy. &ldquo;Only I'll want Pink and the Silent One to stay
      with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep what men yuh want. Anything else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think of anything,&rdquo; said Rowdy. &ldquo;Only I'd like to have a&mdash;talk&mdash;with
      Conroy.&rdquo; Creek eyed him sharply. &ldquo;Yuh won't be apt t' meet him. Old Bill
      Brown, up home, would like to see him, too. Bill's a perseverin' old cuss,
      and wants to see Conroy so bad he's got the sheriff out lookin' for him.
      It's about a bunch uh horses that was run off, three years ago. Yuh
      brought one of 'em back into the country last spring, yuh mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rowdy and Pink looked at one another, but said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Bill, he follered your back trail and found out some things he wanted
      t' know. Conroy got wind of it, though, and he left the agency kind-a
      suddint. No use yuh lookin' for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we're ready to hit the grit, I guess.&rdquo; Rowdy glanced again at Pink
      who nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I ain't stoppin' yuh,&rdquo; Eagle Creek drawled laconically. &ldquo;S'-long,
      and good luck t' yuh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He waited while Pink and the Silent One swung the point back down the
      hill, with Rowdy helping them, quite unmoved by his sudden promotion. When
      the herd was fairly started on the backward march, Eagle Creek nodded
      satisfaction the while he pried off a corner of plug-tobacco.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's all right,&rdquo; he asserted emphatically. &ldquo;That boy suits me, from the
      ground up. If he don't put that deal through in good shape, it'll be
      becaus' it can't be did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wooden Shoes, with whom Rowdy had always been a prime favorite, agreed
      with Dutch heartiness. Then, leaving the herd to its new guardian they
      rode swiftly to overtake and turn back the wagons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three hundred miles! And part of it across howling desert!&rdquo; Rowdy drew
      his brows together. &ldquo;It's a big thing for me, all right, Pink; but it's
      sure a big contract to take this herd through, if anybody should happen to
      ask yuh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, buck up! You'll make good, all right&mdash;if only these creeks
      wasn't so bone dry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there's water enough in the Rocking R field for to-day; we'll throw
      'em in there till tomorrow. And I've a notion I can find a better trail
      across to North Fork than the way we came. I'm going to strike out this
      afternoon and see, anyway, if Quitter Creek hasn't got water farther up.
      Once we get up north uh the home ranch, I can see my way clear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to it, boss,&rdquo; Pink cried heartily. &ldquo;I don't see how I'm goin t' keep
      from sassing yuh, once in a while, though. That's what bothers me. What'll
      happen if I turn loose on yuh, some time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll get fired, I expect,&rdquo; laughed Rowdy, and rode off to announce the
      news to the rest of the outfit, who were very unhappy in their
      mystification.
    </p>
    <p>
      If their reception of the change of plans and foreman was a bit profane,
      and their manner toward him a bit familiar, Rowdy didn't mind. He knew
      that they did not grudge him his good luck, even while they hated the long
      drive. He also knew that they watched him furtively; for nothing&mdash;not
      even misfortune&mdash;is as sure a test of a man's character as success.
      They liked Rowdy, and they did not believe this would spoil him; still,
      every man of them was secretly a bit anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the trail, he rode in his accustomed place, and, so far as appearances
      went, the party had no foreman. He went forward and helped Pink take down
      the fence that had been so carefully put up a few hours before, and he
      whistled while he put it in place again, just as if he had no
      responsibility in the world. Then the cattle were left to themselves, and
      the men rode down to their old campground, marked by empty tin-cans and a
      trodden place where had been the horse corral.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rowdy swung down and faced the men gravely. Instinctively they stood at
      attention, waiting for what he had to say; they felt that the situation
      was so far out of the ordinary that a few remarks pertaining to their new
      relations would not be out of place.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked them over appraisingly, and met glances as grave as his own.
      Straight, capable fellows they were, every man of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; he began impressively, &ldquo;you all know that from to-day on you're
      working under my orders. I never was boss of anything but the cayuse I
      happened to have under me, and I'm going to extract all the honey there is
      in the situation. Maybe I'll never be boss again&mdash;but at present I'm
      it. I want you fellows to remember that important fact, and treat me with
      proper respect. From now on you can call me Mr. Vaughan; 'Rowdy' doesn't
      go, except on a legal holiday.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Furthermore, I'm not going to get out at daylight and catch up my own
      horse; I'll let yuh take turns being flunky, and I'll expect yuh to saddle
      my horse every morning and noon, and bring him to the cook-tent&mdash;and
      hold my stirrup for me. Also, you are expected, at all times and places,
      to anticipate my wants and fall over yourselves waiting on me. You're just
      common, ordinary, forty-dollar cow-punchers, and if I treat yuh white,
      it's because I pity yuh for not being up where I am. Remember, vassals,
      that I'm your superior, mentally, morally, socially&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chap him!&rdquo; yelled Pink, and made for him &ldquo;I'll stand for a lot, but don't
      yuh ever think I'm a vassal!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mutiny is strictly prohibited!&rdquo; he thundered. &ldquo;Villains, beware! Gadzooks&mdash;er&mdash;let's
      have a swim before the wagons come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They laughed and made for the creek, feeling rather crestfallen and a bit
      puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had an outfit like this to run, and a three hundred-mile drive to
      make,&rdquo; Bob Nevin remarked to the Silent One, &ldquo;blessed if I'd make a josh
      of it! I'd cultivate the corrugated brow and the stiff spine&mdash;me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; the Silent One responded, &ldquo;don't be too hasty in your
      judgment. It's because the corrugated brow will come later that he laughs
      now. You'll presently find yourself accomplishing the impossible in
      obedience to the flicker of Rowdy Vaughan's eyelids. Man, did you never
      observe the set of his head, and the look of his eye? Rowdy Vaughan will
      get more out of this crowd than any man ever did; and if he fails, he'll
      fail with the band playing 'Hot Time.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe so,&rdquo; Bob admitted, not quite convinced; &ldquo;but I wonder if he
      realizes what he's up against.&rdquo; At which the Silent One only smiled
      queerly as he splashed into the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner Rowdy caught up the blue roan, which was his favorite for a
      hard ride&mdash;he seemed to have forgotten his speech concerning
      &ldquo;flunkies&rdquo;&mdash;and rode away up the coulee which had brought them into
      the field the night before. The boys watched him go, speculated a lot, and
      went to sleep as the best way of putting in the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pink, who knew quite well what was in Rowdy's mind, said nothing at all;
      it is possible that he was several degrees more jealous of the dignity of
      Rowdy's position than was Rowdy himself, who had no time to think of
      anything but the best way of getting the herd to Canada. He would like to
      have gone along, only that Rowdy did not ask him to. Pink assured himself
      that it was best for Rowdy not to start playing any favorites, and curled
      down in the bed-tent with the others and went to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late that night when Rowdy crept silently into his corner of the
      tent; but Pink was awake, and whispered to know if he found water. Rowdy's
      &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; was a mere breath, but it was enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      At sunrise the herd trailed up the Rocking R coulee, and Pink and the
      Silent One pointed them north of the old trail.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 12. &ldquo;You Can Tell Jessie.&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      In the days that followed Rowdy was much alone. There was water to hunt,
      far ahead of the herd, together with the most practicable way of reaching
      it. He did not take the shortest way across that arid country and leave
      the next day's camping-place to chance&mdash;as Wooden Shoes had done. He
      felt that there was too much at stake, and the cattle were too thin for
      any more dry drives; long drives there were, but such was his generalship
      that there was always water at the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rode miles and miles that he might have shirked, and he never slept
      until the next day's move, at least, was clearly defined in his mind and
      he felt sure that he could do no better by going another route.
    </p>
    <p>
      These lonely rides gave him over to the clutch of thoughts he had never
      before harbored in his sunny nature. Grim, ugly thoughts they were, and
      not nice to remember afterward. They swung persistently around a central
      subject, as the earth revolves around the sun; and, like the earth, they
      turned and turned on the axis of his love for a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      In particularly ugly moods he thought that if Harry Conroy were caught and
      convicted of horsestealing, Jessie must perforce admit his guilt and
      general unworthiness&mdash;Rowdy called it general cussedness&mdash;and
      Rowdy be vindicated in her eyes. Then she would marry him, and go with him
      to the Red Deer country and&mdash;air-castles for miles! When he awoke to
      the argument again, he would tell himself savagely that if he could, by
      any means, bring about Conroy's speedy conviction, he would do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was unlike Rowdy, whose generous charity toward his enemies came near
      being a fault. He might feel any amount of resentment for wrong done, but
      cold-blooded revenge was not in him; that he had suffered so much at
      Conroy's hands was due largely to the fact that Conroy was astute enough
      to read Rowdy aright, and unscrupulous enough to take advantage. Add to
      that a smallminded jealousy of Rowdy's popularity and horsemanship, one
      can easily imagine him doing some rather nasty things. Perhaps the
      meanest, and the one which rankled most in Rowdy's memory, was the cutting
      of Rowdy's latigo just before a riding contest, in which the purse and the
      glory of a championship-belt seemed in danger of going to Rowdy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rowdy had got a fall that crippled him for weeks, and Harry had won the
      purse and belt&mdash;and the enmity of several men better than he. For
      though morally sure of his guilt, no one could prove that he had cut the
      strap, and so he got off unpunished, except that Pink thrashed him&mdash;a
      bit unscientifically, it is true, since he resorted to throwing rocks
      toward the last, but with a thoroughness worthy even of Pink.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in moods less ugly he shrank from the hurt that must be Jessie's if
      she should discover the truth. Jessie's brother a convicted thief serving
      his sentence in Deer Lodge! The thought was horrible; it was brutal
      cruelty. If he could only know where to look for that lad, he'd help him
      out of the country. It was no good shutting him up in jail; that wouldn't
      help him any, or make him better. He hoped he would get off&mdash;go
      somewhere, where they couldn't find him, and stay there.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wondered where he was, and if he had money enough to see him through.
      He might be no good&mdash;he sure wasn't!&mdash;but he was Jessie's
      brother, and Jessie believed in him and thought a lot of him. It would be
      hard lines for that little girl if Harry were caught. Bill Brown, the
      meddlesome old freak!&mdash;he didn't blame Jessie for not wanting to stop
      there that night. She did just the right thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      With all this going round and round, monotonously persistent in his brain,
      and with the care of four thousand lean kine and more than a hundred
      saddle-horses&mdash;to say nothing of a dozen overworked, fretful
      cow-punchers&mdash;Rowdy acquired the &ldquo;corrugated brow&rdquo; fast enough
      without any cultivation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men were as the Silent One had predicted. They made drives that lasted
      far into the night, stood guard, and got along with so little sleep that
      it was scarce worth mention, and did many things that shaved close the
      impossible&mdash;just because Rowdy looked at them straightly, with
      half-closed lids, and asked them if they thought they could.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pink began to speak of their new foreman as &ldquo;Moses&rdquo;; and when the curious
      asked him why, told them soberly that Rowdy could &ldquo;hit a rock with his
      quirt and start a creek running bank full.&rdquo; When Rowdy heard that, he
      thought of the miles of weary searching, and wished that it were true.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had left the home ranch a day's drive behind them, and were going
      north. Rowdy had denied himself the luxury of riding over to see Jessie,
      and he was repenting the sacrifice in deep gloom and sincerity, when two
      men rode into camp and dismounted, as if they had a right. The taller one&mdash;with
      brawn and brain a-plenty, by the look of him&mdash;announced that he was
      the sheriff, and would like to stop overnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rowdy gave him welcome half-heartedly, and questioned him craftily. A
      sheriff is not a detective, and does not mind giving harmless information;
      so Rowdy learned that they had traced Conroy thus far, and believed that
      he was ahead of them and making for Canada. He had dodged them cleverly
      two or three times, but now they had reason to believe that he was not
      more than half a day's ride before them. They wanted to know if the outfit
      had seen any one that day, or sign of any one having passed that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rowdy shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bet it was Harry Conroy driving that little bunch uh horses up the
      creek, just as we come over the ridge,&rdquo; spoke Pink eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rowdy could have choked him. &ldquo;He wouldn't be driving a lot of horses,&rdquo; he
      interposed quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he might,&rdquo; argued Pink. &ldquo;If I was making a quick get-away, and my
      horse was about played out&mdash;like his was apt t' be&mdash;I'd sure
      round up the first bunch I seen, and catch me a fresh one&mdash;if I was a
      horse-thief. I'll bet yuh&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sheriff had put down his cup of coffee. &ldquo;Is there any place where a
      man could corral a bunch on the quiet?&rdquo; he asked crisply. It was evident
      that Pink's theory had impressed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, there is. There's an old corral up at the ford&mdash;Drowning Ford,
      they call it&mdash;that I'd use, if it was me. It was an old line camp,
      and there's a cabin. It's down on the flat by the creek, and it's as
      God-forsaken a place as a man'd want t' hide in, or t' change mounts.&rdquo;
       Pink hitched up his chapbelt and looked across at Rowdy. He was aching for
      a sight of Harry Conroy in handcuffs, and he was certain that Rowdy felt
      the same. &ldquo;If it was me,&rdquo; he added speculatively, &ldquo;and I thought I was far
      enough in the lead, I'd stop there till morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How far is it from here?&rdquo; demanded the sheriff, standing up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pink told him he guessed it was five miles. Whereupon the sheriff
      announced his intention of going up there at once, and Pink hinted rather
      strongly that he would like to go with them. The sheriff did not know
      Pink; he looked down at his slimness and at the yellow fringe of curls
      showing under his hat brim, at his pink cheeks and dimples and girlish
      hands, and threw back his head in a loud ha! ha!
    </p>
    <p>
      Pink asked him politely, but rather stiffly, what there was funny about
      it. The sheriff laughed louder and longer; then, being the sort of man who
      likes a joke now and then, even in the way of business, he solemnly
      deputized Pink, and patted him on the shoulder and told him gravely that
      they couldn't possibly do without him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It looked for a minute as if Pink were going at him with his fists&mdash;but
      he didn't. He reflected that one must not offer violence to an officer of
      the law, and that, being made a deputy, he would have to go, anyway; so he
      gritted his teeth and buckled on his gun, and went along sulkily.
    </p>
    <p>
      They rode silently, for the most part, and swiftly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even in the dusk they could see where a band of horses had been driven at
      a gallop along the creek bank. When they neared the place it was dark.
      Pink pulled up and spoke for the first time since leaving the tent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We better tie up our horses here and walk,&rdquo; he said, quite unconscious of
      the fact that he was usurping the leadership, and thinking only of their
      quest.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the sheriff was old at the business, and not too jealous of his
      position. He signed to his deputy proper, and they dismounted.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they started on, Pink was ahead. The sheriff observed that Pink's gun
      still swung in its scabbard at his hip, and he grinned&mdash;but that was
      because he didn't know Pink. That the gun swung at his hip would have been
      quite enough for any one who did know him; it didn't take Pink all day to
      get into action.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten rods from the corral, which they could distinguish as a black blotch
      in the sparse willow growth, Pink turned and stopped them. &ldquo;I know the
      layout here,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;I'll just sneak ahead and rubber around. You
      Rubes sound like the beginning of a stampede, in this brush.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sheriff had never before been called a Rube&mdash;to his face, at
      least. The audacity took his breath; and when he opened his mouth for
      scathing speech, Pink was not there. He had slipped away, like a slim,
      elusive shadow, and the sheriff did not even know the exact direction of
      his going. There was nothing for it but to wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      In five minutes Pink appeared with a silent suddenness that startled them
      more than they would like to own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's somewheres around,&rdquo; he announced, in a murmur that would not carry
      ten feet. &ldquo;He's got a horse in the corral, and, from the sound, he's got
      him all saddled; and the gate's tied shut with a rope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How d'yuh know?&rdquo; grunted the sheriff crossly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Felt of it, yuh chump. He's turned the bunch loose and kept up a fresh
      one, like I said he would. It's blame dark, but I could see the horse&mdash;a
      big white devil. It's him yuh hear makin' all that racket. If he gits away
      now&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we didn't come for a chin-whackin' bee,&rdquo; snapped the sheriff. &ldquo;I
      come out here t' git him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pink gritted his teeth again, and wished the sheriff was just a man, so he
      could lick him. He led them forward without a word, thinking that Rowdy
      wanted Harry Conroy captured.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sheriff circled warily the corral, peered through the rails at the
      great white horse that ran here and there, whinnying occasionally for the
      band, and heard the creak of leather and the rattle of the bit. Pink was
      right; the horse was saddled, ready for immediate flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe he's in the cabin,&rdquo; he whispered, coming up where Pink stood
      listening tensely at all the little night sounds. Pink turned and crept
      silently to the right, keeping in the deepest shade, while the others
      followed willingly. They were beginning to see the great advantage of
      having Pink along, even if he had called them Rubes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cabin door yawned wide open, and creaked weirdly as the light wind
      moved it; the interior was black and silent&mdash;suspiciously silent, in
      the opinion of the sheriff. He waited for some time before venturing in,
      fearing an ambush. Then he caught the flicker of a shielded match, called
      out to Conroy to surrender, and leveled his gun at the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no answer but the faint shuffle of stealthy feet on the board
      floor. The sheriff called another warning, cocked his gun&mdash;and came
      near shooting Pink, who walked composedly out of the door into the
      sheriff's astonished face. The sheriff had been sure that Pink was just
      behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the hell,&rdquo; began the sheriff explosively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ain't here,&rdquo; said Pink simply. &ldquo;I crawled in the window and hunted the
      place over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sheriff glared at him dumbly; he could not reconcile Pink's daredevil
      behavior with Pink's innocent, girlish appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell yuh the corral's what we want t' keep cases on,&rdquo; Pink added
      insistently. &ldquo;He's sure somewheres around&mdash;I'd gamble on it. He
      saddled that horse t' git away on. That horse is sure the key t' this
      situation, old-timer. If you fellows'll keep cases on the gate, I'll cover
      the rear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made his way quietly to the back of the corral, inwardly much amused at
      the tractability of the sheriff, who took his deputy obediently to watch
      the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pink squatted comfortably in the shade of a willow and wished he dared
      indulge in a cigarette, and wondered what scheme Harry was trying to play.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fifty feet away the big white horse still circled round and round,
      rattling his bridle impatiently and shaking the saddle in an occasional
      access of rage, and whinnying lonesomely out into the gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they waited and waited, and peered into the shadows, and listened to
      the trampling horse fretting for freedom and his mates.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cook had just called breakfast when Pink dashed up to the tent, flung
      himself from his horse, and confronted Rowdy&mdash;a hollow-eyed, haggard
      Rowdy who had not slept all night, and whose eyes questioned anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Rowdy said, with what passed for composure, &ldquo;did you get him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pink leaned against his horse, with one hand reaching up and gripping
      tightly the horn of the saddle. His cheeks held not a trace of color, and
      his eyes were full of a great horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're bringin' him t' camp,&rdquo; he answered huskily. &ldquo;We found a horse&mdash;a
      big white horse they call the Fern Outlaw&rdquo;&mdash;the Silent One started
      and came closer, listening intently; evidently he knew the horse&mdash;&ldquo;saddled
      in the corral, and the gate tied shut. We dubbed around a while, but we
      didn't find&mdash;Harry. So we camped down by the corral and waited. We
      set there all night&mdash;and the horse faunching around inside something
      fierce. When&mdash;it come daybreak&mdash;I seen something&mdash;by the
      fence, inside. It was&mdash;Harry.&rdquo; Pink shivered and moistened his dry
      lips. &ldquo;That Fern Outlaw&mdash;some uh the boys know&mdash;is a devil t'
      mount. He'd got Harry down&mdash;hell, Rowdy! it&mdash;it was sure&mdash;awful.
      He'd been there all night&mdash;and that horse stomping.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; Rowdy turned all at once deathly sick. He had once seen a man
      who had been trampled by a maddened, man-killing horse. It had not been a
      pretty sight. He sat down weakly and covered his face with his shaking
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The others stood around horrified, muttering disjointed, shocked
      sentences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pink lifted his head from where it had fallen upon his arm. &ldquo;One thing,
      Rowdy&mdash;I done. You can tell Jessie. I shot that horse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rowdy dropped his hands and stood up. Yes, he must tell Jessie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll have to take the herd on,&rdquo; he told Pink in his masterful way.
      &ldquo;I'll catch you to-morrow some time. I've got to go back and tell Jessie.
      You know the trail I was going to take&mdash;straight across to Wild Horse
      Lake. From there you strike across to North Fork&mdash;and if I don't
      overtake you on the way, I'll hit camp some time in the night. It's all
      plain sailing.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 13. Rowdy Finds Happiness.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Miss Conroy was rather listlessly endeavoring to persuade the First Reader
      class that &ldquo;catch&rdquo; should not be pronounced &ldquo;ketch,&rdquo; when she saw Rowdy
      ride past the window. Intuition of something amiss sent her to the door
      before he reached it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't you give the kids a day off?&rdquo; he began, without preface. &ldquo;I've got
      such a lot to talk about&mdash;and I don't come very often.&rdquo; He thought
      that his tone was perfectly natural; but all the same she turned white. He
      rode on to a little tree and tied his horse&mdash;not that it was
      necessary to tie him, but to avoid questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Conroy went in and dismissed the children, although it was only
      fifteen minutes after nine. They gathered up their lunch-pails and
      straggled out reluctantly, round-eyed, and curious. Rowdy waited until the
      last one had gone before he went in. Miss Conroy sat in her chair on the
      platform, and she was still white; otherwise she seemed to have herself
      well in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's about Harry,&rdquo; she asserted, rather sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have they&mdash;caught him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rowdy stopped half-way down the aisle and stared. &ldquo;How did you know they
      were&mdash;after him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He came to me night before last, and&mdash;told me.&rdquo; She bit her lip,
      took firm hold on her honesty and her courage, and went on steadily. &ldquo;He
      came because he&mdash;wanted money. I've wanted to see you since, to tell
      you that&mdash;I misjudged you. I know all about your&mdash;trouble, and I
      want you to know that I think you are&mdash;that you did quite right. You
      are to understand that I cannot honestly uphold&mdash;Harry. He is&mdash;not
      the kind of brother&mdash;I thought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rowdy went clanking forward till only the table stood between. &ldquo;Did he
      tell you?&rdquo; he demanded, in a curious, breathless fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he did not. He denied everything. It was Pink. He told me long ago&mdash;that
      evening, just after you&mdash;the last time I saw you. I told him he&mdash;lied.
      I tried not to believe it, but I did. Pink knew I would; he said so. The
      other night I asked Harry about&mdash;those things he did to you. He lied
      to me. I'd have forgiven him&mdash;but he lied. I&mdash;can't forgive
      that. I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; Rowdy threw out a gloved hand quickly. He could not bear to let
      her go on like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up at him, and all at once she was shaking. &ldquo;There's something&mdash;tell
      me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They didn't take him,&rdquo; he said slowly, weighing each word and looking
      down at her pityingly &ldquo;They never will. He&mdash;had an accident. A horse&mdash;fell
      with him&mdash;and&mdash;he was dead when they picked him up.&rdquo; It was as
      merciful a version as he could make it, but the words choked him, even
      then. &ldquo;Girlie!&rdquo; He went around and knelt, with his arms holding her close.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a long while he spoke again, smoothing her hair absently, and never
      noticing that he had not taken off his gloves. His gray hat was pushed
      aslant as his head rested against hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps, girlie, it's for the best. We couldn't have saved him from&mdash;the
      other; and that would have been worse, don't you think? We'll forget all
      but the good in him&rdquo;&mdash;he could not help thinking that there would not
      be much to remember&mdash;&ldquo;and I'll get a little home ready, and come back
      and get you before snow flies&mdash;and&mdash;you'll be kind of happy,
      won't you?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe you haven't heard&mdash;but Eagle Creek has made me foreman of his
      outfit that's going to Canada. It's a good position. I can make you
      comfortable, girlie&mdash;and happy. Anyway, I'll try, mighty hard. You'll
      be ready for me when I come&mdash;won't you, girlie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Conroy raised her face, all tear-stained, but, with the light of
      happiness fighting the sorrow in her eyes, nodded just enough to make the
      movement perceptible, and settled her head to a more comfortable
      nestling-place on his shoulder.

corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
